# Open Music Registers


This project aims to establish open, structured, and interoperable registers that describe the economic activities and business entities in the music sector. It supports better policymaking, research, and innovation through shared data infrastructures and standards, particularly aligning with the European Data Strategy and sector-specific needs.

## Project Structure

This repository uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to generate a technical book. The key chapters include:

-   `references.qmd`: Bibliography and references

-   `appendix-how_to_use.qmd`: Practical guidance for users

The documentation is continuously updated to support the development of linked open datasets and practical register management tools.

`bib`: The folder contains all the bibliography.

-   `bib/ddex.bib`: Bibliography for the DDEX music metadata standards.
-   `bib/ISOdata.bib`: Bibliography for the ISO music or publishing metadata standards.
