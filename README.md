Open Music Registers

## Bibliography

`bib`: The folder contains all the bibliography.

-   `bib/musiceducation`: music education, including informal learning.

## Images

We save visualisations in folders corresponding to the file format.

`png`: contains visualisations in Portable Network Graphics format (our preferred format.)

## Exceptions

The `.gitignore` contains the exceptions that are not synchronized to the repository. These are the rendered html files and their supporting JavaScript, CSS and other auxiliary files. They should build on everybody's computer flawlessly.
