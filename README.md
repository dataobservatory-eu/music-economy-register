# Open Music Registers

-   `ambition.qmd`: **Introduces the concept and rationale for open music registers**, emphasizing the benefits of harmonising registration processes to reduce duplication, increase data quality, and support policy, rights, and research applications across the music ecosystem.

-   `t12.qmd`: **Describes the structure and function of the Slovak Music Economy Register**, focusing on how it collects and models data about individuals and organisations (agents), and how it supports interoperability with national and international data systems for statistical and economic use.

-   `surveying.qmd`: **Outlines the requirements for using the register as a survey frame**, particularly how to define populations and link survey responses to variables in line with GSIM and DDI standards. It sketches the foundation for an integrated system of harmonised administrative and sample surveys.
