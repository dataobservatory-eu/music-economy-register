# Ambition: music registers that work together {#sec-ambition}

When someone registers a new person or entity in a system, they are identifying a subject and attaching key facts about them to a consistent record. Today, such records are almost always managed through spreadsheet tables or relational databases. However, as digital services multiply, maintaining parallel registries for every new purpose has become a tedious, error-prone, and increasingly problematic practice. Artists, their groups, and their associations are asked to submit more and more structured data — often without full oversight or control over where and how this information is stored or reused.

Our vision is a **shared registration process**: a unified platform where an artist can fill out a single form to submit the necessary data and documents, grant GDPR-compliant consent, and manage their information over time. Through this interface, they could register and maintain data for multiple purposes — including rights management, public funding, and broader visibility through open knowledge platforms.

This shared process would support data needs across: - collecting societies - cultural ministries - national statistical institutes - international databases like Wikidata or MusicBrainz - streaming and discovery services

The artist remains the source of truth. With proper consent and traceability, each registration contributes to a connected ecosystem.

![The composer Iris Szeghy was one of the first persons who allowed her data to be used in our shared register. With her example we show how the coordination or registration processes can lead to better music services for music users and researchers. See [our presentation](https://reprex.nl/event/2024-11-21_iamic/) for the International Association of Music Information Centers.](png/skcmdb/iris_szeghy_identity.png){fig-align="center"}

This illustrates how a harmonised registration process can support both cultural recognition and reuse.

If you are a self-releasing artist or artist manager, you probably fill out dozens of registration forms each year — for databases, web platforms, grant applications, copyright management, and more. Over time, it's easy to lose track. And while you may forget these forms, your data doesn't: it lives on, often duplicated, outdated, or disconnected — scattered across the internet. It's a bit like space debris: years of untracked, obsolete data floating around. Each new registration risks colliding with the old unless registers are connected and responsibly maintained.

![Our systems allows a vertical data exchange, which allow that trusted, cooperating music organisations cross-check their data about artists and their works, recordings, releases, and then make them available for streaming providers, festival promoters, radio editors and other users.](png/omo/data_enrichment_dissemination.png)

The time has come for technology that connects these registers, returns control to the artist, and enables a single, authoritative point of truth for reliable, maintained data.

This system should not only save time for both artists and service providers, but also increase transparency, improve data quality, and support informed consent in the management of professional and personal information. In the longer term, it could enable regular reviews, help artists monitor where and how their data is used, and offer feedback on the quality and discoverability of their public profile.

![We use the European Interoperability Framework as a general conceptual guideline to create a multi-purpose, interoperable registration process.](png/eif/eif_4_layers_en_2x1.png)

This ambition builds on earlier research and practical experience, which we summarise in the next section.

## Identification and Attribution Strategy in Open Music Registers

The `Open Music Registers` initiative is grounded in a pragmatic approach to managing the balance between identification and attribution of entities within the music economy. We recognize that both processes are essential but costly and potentially error-prone. Therefore, our strategy is to minimize duplication, maximize reuse, and support reliable identification processes wherever feasible.

Identification refers to recognizing and linking entities—such as musical works, rightsholders, and recordings—to existing, trustworthy identifiers. Where reliable identification services are in place (e.g., ISNI for persons, VIAF for authority control, ISWC for musical works managed locally by SOZA), we prioritize integration and reuse. We aim to support identification efforts, for example, by assisting SOZA in reducing the costs of work identification and helping the Slovak National Library verify manifestations through structured metadata contributions.

Attribution involves actively assigning identifiers, typically when no existing trusted identifier is available. When necessary, the `Open Music Registers` facilitate attribution processes, but always with care to follow international best practices and to avoid unnecessary parallel identification efforts.

In practice, metadata management costs in the music sector are often disproportionately high relative to the economic value of the assets. Many musical works generate only a few cents in royalties per month—or even less—while the costs of accurate identification, attribution, and metadata maintenance can easily exceed these earnings. The music ecosystem is exceptionally complex: hundreds of millions of assets are connected to millions of rightsholders, whose circumstances (names, publishers, labels, heirs) frequently change.

This complexity contributes to systemic problems in royalty distribution, rights management, and cultural visibility. Without cost-effective metadata solutions, the economic viability of accurate rights management becomes unsustainable, especially for small rightsholders and emerging artists. Left unchecked, this creates a vicious circle: assets remain under-identified, royalties are misdirected or delayed, trust in the system erodes, and the overall cultural economy suffers.

The `Open Music Registers` project is designed to break this cycle by:

-   Trusting and reusing validated attribution results from authoritative registrars.
-   Undertaking new identification only when necessary and justified.
-   Avoiding duplication and parallel registration processes.
-   Lowering the burden on artists and registrars alike through interoperability and shared infrastructure.

By strategically balancing identification and attribution, and by building efficient, scalable metadata solutions, we aim to ensure that music assets can be properly valued, fairly remunerated, and sustainably managed—even when the economic value per asset is modest.

## Preceding results from Open Music Europe WP1

This work builds on the statistical and methodological foundation laid by the `Open Music Europe` project. One of the project's central insights is that, although digital metadata about the music economy is increasingly abundant, core economic indicators — such as employment, income, and production investment — are still poorly captured in national and European statistics.

Two former deliverables helped map this gap. The first, a European-wide methodological assessment `D1.1` [@antal_et_al_music_economy_2023], presented in Bratislava in 2023, showed that fragmented data collection practices limit the use of standard economic codes such as `NACE` and `ISIC`. It recommended building open, artist-facing infrastructures that allow music professionals to register their data once and have it reused across multiple systems — for research, rights management, or policy analysis.

The second study [@antal_slovak-cult-stat-pilot], demonstrated how data could flow between music organisations, statistical offices, and national registers. It reused earlier national surveys — `KULT05`, `KULT16`, and `KULT19` — which had gathered useful information about music creators and organisations. However, those surveys lacked persistent identifiers and mechanisms for updates over time.

The `Slovak Music Economy Register` — developed under Task T1.2 — responds directly to this challenge. It aims to maintain a live, updateable register of music professionals and organisations, combining survey data, rights management records, and self-registered entries. It is part of the larger `Slovak Comprehensive Music Database` (SKCMDb), which also contains registers of musical works, sound recordings, and performance venues. Together, these connected datasets support better cultural statistics, rights attribution, and policy design.

By integrating sources like SOZA (the Slovak collective management organisation) and the Slovak Music Centre, the register creates a flexible but standards-compliant way to track economic activity in the music sector — one that respects national statistical needs while also supporting transparency, interoperability, and creator rights.

## Harmoinsed registers for better research data collection and statistical production

In statistical terms, a *register* is a structured list or database that systematically tracks units of interest—typically enterprises, individuals, or institutions—over time. Public statistical authorities often maintain *population registers* or *enterprise registers* that serve as the backbone for sampling, indicator production, and policy monitoring.

However, in many industries, particularly cultural and creative ones, official registers are incomplete or too broad, grouping diverse sectors under umbrella codes like NACE `J58` or `R90`. This is partly because the typical organisation size in these industries is smaller than the enterprise size that participates in traditional, mandatory sample-survey statistical production, and partly due to the high level of informality in these sectors, as reported in `T1.1` see [@antal_et_al_music_economy_2023; @antal_slovak-cult-stat-pilot]. These classifications dilute the specificity needed for meaningful data analysis. For instance, a music enterprise might be lumped together with film postproduction, making the resulting statistics less actionable for business decision-making or targeted public policy.

In contrast, private organisations often maintain richer, more detailed internal registers for their operations. These might include::

-   *Membership lists* maintained by professional associations or unions, such as those representing music publishing entities or record labels. For example, we created a Slovak register of music publishers; under the collective management directive[@eu_directive_2014_26], such registers must be made public, even if not well-structured.

-   *Client databases* used by CMOs or licensing agencies, detailing entities like restaurants that play music. While these databases are proprietary, public business registers or local registers of licensed venues (e.g., restaurants, music clubs requiring local permission due to noise and traffic considerations) can help create connected music user registers.

-   *CRMs* (Customer Relationship Management systems) used by businesses for managing partners and contractors.

While these private registers are typically well-aligned with operational needs, they are not harmonised with national statistical systems—meaning identifiers (e.g., tax IDs, sector codes, geographic location data) may not match, formats vary, and there’s no common protocol for data structure or update frequency.

**Harmonisation**, in this context, does not mean full integration but rather the voluntary alignment of **key reference variables** and **metadata**:

-   Using public identifiers (e.g., business registry numbers),

-   Mapping internal categories to standard classifications like NACE or ISIC,

-   Agreeing on common reference periods and geographical codes.

With minimal effort, private actors can enhance the *statistical usability* of their data while still serving their internal purposes. This opens the door for *interoperability*, *cross-validation*, and more efficient data sharing—all without relinquishing control over proprietary data. We will illustrate these efforts in the next section of this document.

Efforts to harmonise registers across private and public actors also create the foundation for more advanced and resilient forms of **statistical production**. As previously noted, when data collection and processing can happen closer to the data source—whether through sampling, microdata preparation, or anonymised outputs—we reduce both privacy risks and operational burdens. This distributed model of statistical production reflects an important shift: the production of public value is no longer confined to the walls of official statistical offices but extended into the data infrastructures of cooperating institutions.

These changes are supported and legitimised by a growing ecosystem of **European data governance frameworks**, including the *Data Governance Ac* [@eu_data_governance_act_2021] and *Data Act* [@eu_data_act_2023], which encourage secure and fair reuse of privately held data for public interest purposes. More ambitiously, the development of **European Common Data Spaces**—such as the *Cultural Heritage Data Space* and upcoming *Media and Creative Industries Data Space*—aims to build sector-specific environments where data can be shared, pooled, and reused under common rules and interoperable standards. In *Open Music Europe*, we aim at the creation of a small, extendible music data space in the form of the *Open Music Observatory* that can federate data with other parts of the European data spaces.

Together, these legal, technical, and institutional innovations represent a new chapter in the co-production of knowledge: one where governments, cultural institutions, and private sector actors jointly curate the evidence base needed to shape smarter, more responsive policy.

## Why a Dataspace?

In building the `Open Music Registers`, we deliberately avoided merging different data sources into a single centralised database. This decision reflects the lessons learned and best practices laid out in the *UN Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers* [@un_sbr_guidelines_2024], and the microdata coordination of the Dutch statistical authority, CBS [@sun_cbs_knowledge_graph_2021].

A register aims to be a complete list of the objects in a specific group or population [@anders_register-based_2007]. Norway created statistical registers to tap into governmental data stores in 1990 and into municipal ones in 1995; by 2019, it utilised about 100 records and drew data from 30 public institutional sources [@saebo_new_data_sources_2023, p. 1]. Like most countries, such "administrative data" was retrieved from other governmental entities, not the private sector, and at the same time replaced almost all sample surveys which had inferior data qualities.

A statistical business register (SBR) is a regularly updated, structured database of economic units in a territorial area, maintained by a national statistical office, and used for statistical purposes.

In official statistics, the Statistical Business Register (SBR) is the foundational frame for producing core statistical products: enterprise statistics, labour market statistics, and ultimately, derived indicators like the GDP. As the Guidelines emphasise:

> "High-quality business statistics depend on a high-quality SBR. A high-quality SBR fulfils the user needs in an optimal way, and is based on international concepts, definitions and classifications. Thus, it serves as the basis for international harmonisation of economic statistics in terms of coverage, statistical units and frame methodology." [@un_sbrguidelines_2024, p2]

Building a statistical business register is not a mechanical task of merging administrative sources.

> "Even if the SBR is based on information from administrative registers, the concepts, characteristics, methods of maintenance, and other aspects of the SBR need to be based on statistical concepts." [@un_sbrguidelines_2024, p4]

Official statisticians must carefully construct statistical units from diverse administrative sources — such as tax records, company registries, and social security data — which differ in legal basis, workflows, update cycles, and semantic structures.

Similarly, in `Open Music Registers`, our sources include copyright registration systems, library authority files, repertoire asset lists, and royalty accounting databases. These sources have different legal status, different operational goals, and different metadata models. Therefore, just as statistical agencies cannot simply merge administrative registers, we cannot simply merge these music-sector registers.

Instead, our approach mirrors that of official statisticians: harmonisation through shared semantics and carefully coordinated data linkage.

In official SBRs, the statistical office typically has legal authority to impose common taxonomies, data standards, and reporting obligations. This greatly simplifies harmonisation, but even then, good cooperation is required by statistical authorities, too.

> "Technical and organisational issues hampering access by national statistical offices to administrative databases can be addressed by establishing good cooperation with administrative bodies, ideally formalised in memoranda of understanding." [@un_sbrguidelines_2024, p6]

In contrast, a data sharing space like `Open Music Registers` cannot rely on hierarchical authority. Instead, we operate under the voluntary, consensus-based model typical of data spaces:

-   Metadata semantics (the definitions of terms and structures) are pre-agreed among participants.

-   Actual data exchange happens only on an as-needed, as-permitted basis, respecting data licences, contractual rights, and privacy regulations.

-   Differences in workflows and purposes — for example between a rights management organisation and a national library — must be reconciled collaboratively through decentralised negotiation, not imposed centrally.

This makes data harmonisation slower, but it also ensures higher resilience, broader participation, and stronger trust among stakeholders — goals very much aligned with the emerging standards for European data spaces and FAIR data principles.

> *Dataspaces: Fundamentals, Principles, and Technique*: "A dataspace is an emerging approach to data management which recognises that in large-scale integration scenarios, involving thousands of data sources, it is difficult and expensive to obtain an upfront unifying schema across all sources. Data is integrated on an \`as-needed' basis with the labour-intensive aspects of data integration postponed until they are required. Dataspaces reduce the initial effort required to set up data integration by relying on automatic matching and mapping generation techniques." [@curry_dataspaces_2020]

> *Dataspace for Cultural and Creative Industries* (Position paper): "A data space is an ecosystem of exchange, processing, sharing and provision of data between trusted partners, for a fee or not. It is not about copying or repatriating data centrally, but about ensuring that each data holder has full control over the conditions (e.g., who, when, and under what condition) of access to their data." [@dataspace_for_cci_2022, p16]

As we developed the `Open Music Registers`, we recognised that traditional database architectures would be insufficient for our goals. Our challenge resembled those faced by national statistical offices: the metadata about music agents, works, and performances is dispersed across many organisations, collected under different legal mandates, maintained with diverse standards, and updated for different operational needs. Following emerging best practices in official statistics, particularly those demonstrated by Statistics Netherlands (CBS), we chose to create a knowledge graph-based infrastructure [@sun_cbs_knowledge_graph_2021]; by doing so, the CBS has de facto implemented a data sharing space structure.

Instead of imposing centralised control over the sources, we harmonise their metadata using shared ontologies (such as DCTERMS, CIDOC-CRM, and music-specific standards like ISWC, ISNI, ISRC) and link the underlying datasets through interoperable, semantic structures. This approach enables flexible, incremental integration across the music sector, while preserving the autonomy and legal rights of each data contributor.

The CBS Microdata project offers a clear parallel to our ambition. Faced with fragmented, departmentally managed microdata collections, CBS built a knowledge graph to unify metadata across its research datasets, using standard vocabularies such as DCAT and Dublin Core Terms. They extracted key information from separate PDF documents, mapped variables to standard ontologies, and created an RDF-based knowledge graph to support researchers seeking to combine and explore disparate datasets. Like CBS, we aim not merely to connect databases, but to create an integrated semantic environment where different registration workflows—rights management, public libraries, music asset lists—can be understood and cross-referenced. Just as CBS facilitates high-quality, FAIR-compliant research across domains like health, education, and employment, Open Music Registers will support rights management, cultural research, policy evaluation, and statistical production across the music economy.

Our ambition does not stop here. Statistical authorities increasingly realise that cooperation with data-rich private sector organisations can improve the quality of official statistics. Why ask imprecise and boring consumer purchase diaries about household holding when credit-card companies have exact data about more than 95% of all purchases? Statistics Norway realised that instead of asking 7,000 households what they were buying in the supermarket, it is far more accurate and potentially cheaper to acquire the data directly from the sales logs of the supermarkets or the payment transaction records of the credit card companies. Ask indirectly household energy use when the electricity trading and distribution system has the energy use data of every building and household? French statisticians prefer this data source.

As explained in our preceding T1.1 [@antal_slovak-cult-stat-pilot], the data space aproach, and the utilisation of the same metadata standards, allow a potential cooperation with Slovakia's cultural satellite accounts. For this, we needed to follow recent international guidelines on using privately held data for official statistics [@unece_sbr_guidelines_2015; @un_sbr_guidelines_2020; @eurostat_sbr_manual_2021], and more broadly from the policy and research literature on business-to-government data sharing [@ess_position_privately_held_2017; @hleg_towards_b2g_data_2020; @vigorito_privately_held_2022; @susha_b2g_data_2022]. Such complex legal, security and organisational requirements also help design similarly high-quality processes when sharing data among private partners.

## Why Wikibase?

> Wikibase is the open-source software platform that powers Wikidata — the largest open knowledge graph on the internet. It enables organizations to create their own structured, linked, multilingual databases, while remaining interoperable with global ecosystems like Wikidata. By using Wikibase, `Open Music Registers` can build an independent but connected knowledge base that integrates identifiers, metadata, and factual information from many sources, while retaining control over the quality, governance, and authority of the data.

We are building a **knowledge base** that enables the combination of data, information, and knowledge about music in novel and valuable ways. This requires us to integrate resources that were traditionally managed separately, each within different professional, commercial, or cultural workflows. As a result, we must work with identifiers developed by various stakeholders concerned with the production, commercialisation, documentation, and preservation of manifestations of music, or knowledge about music — whether it concerns printed scores, MIDI files, sound recordings, audiovisual content, or books about music.

Every domain — whether music, publishing, research, business, or cultural heritage — has developed its own identification systems, each optimised for the specific needs of that sector. Following the evolution outlined by Laura Manzoni, the development of modern identifiers reflects a growing need for persistent, stable, and interoperable ways to *identify resources*, not only online, but across the entire information infrastructure [@manzoni_identifiers_2022].

-   **ISBN (International Standard Book Number)** was introduced in 1967–1970 to uniquely identify books and other monographic publications. It ensures that each edition of a book can be cited and tracked across publishers, libraries, and sales platform.

-   **ISMN (International Standard Music Number)** followed to identify printed music (sheet music scores) across publishers and distributors. It originally started a numeric range of ISBN, but by now printed sheet music has its own registration system [@iso_ismn_2021]. We work with print music diversity and circulation in WP2. 

-   **ISRC (International Standard Recording Code)** was created in 1986 to uniquely identify individual sound recordings and music video recordings, independent of their format (CD, vinyl, digital download). It tracks usage and royalties across rights management systems [@iso_isrc_2019; @camp_isni_2022]. We work with recorded music diversity and circulation in WP2. 

-   **ISWC (International Standard Musical Work Code)**, introduced in the 1990s, identifies musical works (i.e., the underlying composition or lyrics) rather than any particular recording or performance. It is used by collective management organisations (CMOs) to track royalties and rights across performances, broadcasts, and reproductions [@iso_iswc_2022].

-   **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)**, established in the late 1990s, providing persistent identification of digital objects (articles, datasets, reports, etc.) independently from where they are hosted. Unlike a URL, the DOI remains stable even if the resource moves.

-   **ISNI** identifies individual creators, performers, and contributors.

-   **ISBN** identifies books and printed editions (including music books) .

-   **OpenCorporatesID** identifies legal corporate bodies and music business organisations.

These different identifiers capture different aspects of musical and cultural reality. They serve different workflows — such as royalty collection, publishing, research citation, market transparency — and operate under different legal and technical frameworks. If we want to *increase the interoperability* of services and systems that use music metadata — including rights management, cultural heritage, statistical analysis, or AI-driven discovery — we must ensure that *the identification of the same thing or person across contexts is connected*.

This is why we are not building a "single system" of identification, but rather a hub of connections between identifiers, anchored by careful mappings between authoritative registers, and supported by persistent, machine-readable links.

In this model, Wikidata functions as an **identity broker** — a global open knowledge graph that aggregates and connects identifiers from many domains, linking them to structured factual data.

By following this approach, `Open Music Registers` does not replace existing authority systems, but connects them intelligently, allowing music agents, works, performances, recordings, and organisations to be discovered, verified, linked, and reused across multiple platforms and sectors.

In recent years, Wikidata’s role as an identity broker has been recognised and increasingly trusted by major institutions in cultural heritage, education, and research.

Studies have shown that UNESCO, Creative Commons, national libraries, research funders, and large-scale digital humanities projects actively integrate Wikidata identifiers to improve metadata quality, enable multilingual access, and facilitate cross-domain interoperability [@van_veen_wikidata_2019; @bianchini_beyond_2021; @bianchini_sardo_2022; @fagerving_wikidata_2023]. This growing trust stems from Wikidata’s capacity to link persistent identifiers from different authoritative systems — such as VIAF, ISNI, DOI, ISBN, and institutional databases — into a public, machine-readable knowledge graph that supports both human discovery and automated services at a global scale.

In fact, it shows that there is no need for one standardization of practices for establishing the headings and structure of authority records in one international form; instead, users’ convenience can be achieved by a technological infrastructure capable to present to each user the information about an entity in its own language and script. Additionally, Wikidata is the most evident example of the distributed and diffused approach of the semantic web to the issue of the universal identification of the entities. Also, Wikidata identification and description show that authority and bibliograp

This approach is now also reflected in major European policy initiatives. The EU Knowledge Graph, developed as part of the European Commission’s linked data strategy, is building a cross-domain graph that explicitly integrates references from Wikidata, authority files, open registries, and official databases, recognising the need for semantic mediation across scientific, cultural, economic, and administrative domains [@diefenbach_wikibase_2021]. Rather than replacing local or domain-specific authority files, Wikidata — and projects modelled on it — connect them, acting as a semantic bridge across fragmented information ecosystems.

This strategy is particularly powerful for cultural and creative domains like music, where different aspects of the same reality (creative works, recordings, performances, corporate actors) are registered in specialised, non-overlapping systems.

## Forms of music or music entities

Our primary interest is not necessarily in the data subject but in their music, particularly their work (the occupation, artistic or economic activity they are engaged in) and its result in new music entities, such as works and their recorded and print manifestations. Copyrights and neighbouring rights connected to these entities, and their revenues. Event where and when these works are recorded or performed for an audience.

We are particularly interested in a parallel registration of works and the recorded fixations of their studio and staged performances intended for the public. (For example, we do not want to provide interoperability for recording information about rehearsals or liturgical uses of music for spiritual or faith-based communities.)

| Subject | What is their role? |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| musical work | Composed of a combination of sounds, with or without accompanying text [@iso_iswc_2022] |
| performance |  |
| live performance | The performance of music in front of a live audience. |
| recorded performance | The performance of music, interpreted from a musical work or improvised, with the aim of creating a recording. |
| sound recording | A recorded fixation, released for commercial or non-commercial use, an re-playable object from a recorded performance. |
| music venue | A building, a publicly accessible site, a piece of infrastructure or built structure where music is played for the public. |

## Technical harmonisation

Private entities can enhance the statistical usability of their data with relatively small effort, maintaining their internal operational needs while enabling interoperability, cross-validation, and efficient data sharing. This approach allows for collaboration without compromising control over proprietary information. The Open Music Observatory and the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database (SKCMDb) exemplify innovative methods of semantic data integration, bridging statistics and private cultural data infrastructures.

We employ Wikibase, an open-source platform underpinning Wikidata, to create a "private Wikidata" environment. This setup offers high visibility, reusability, and collaborative potential. By leveraging a widely adopted, multilingual knowledge graph, we lower barriers to integration and reuse, benefiting statistical agencies and cultural researchers alike.

Mapping data from organizations such as SOZA, the Slovak Music Centre, the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, and the Slovak National Library to standard classifications like ESCO, SDMX, NACE, and ISCO establishes semantic connections between internal datasets and international frameworks. This strategy enhances statistical interoperability, supports multilingual capabilities, and facilitates automated updates, making the data more accessible and AI-ready.

The `Open Music Observatory` not only links music industry business data but also integrates cultural, labour, and economic dimensions. This comprehensive approach aligns with the objectives of cultural satellite accounts and Common Data Spaces initiatives. In this deliverable, we demonstrate how measuring the labour and cultural aspects of music can be supported through data infrastructures based on shared registration processes and harmonized registers.
