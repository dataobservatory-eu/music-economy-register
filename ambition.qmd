# Ambition: music registers that work together {#sec-ambition}

When someone registers a new person or entity in a system, they are identifying a subject and attaching key facts about them to a consistent record. Today, such records are almost always managed through spreadsheet tables or relational databases. However, as digital services multiply, maintaining parallel registries for every new purpose has become a tedious, error-prone, and increasingly problematic practice. Artists, their groups, and their associations are asked to submit more and more structured data — often without full oversight or control over where and how this information is stored or reused.

Our vision is a **shared registration process**: a unified platform where an artist can fill out a single form to submit the necessary data and documents, grant GDPR-compliant consent, and manage their information over time. Through this interface, they could register and maintain data for multiple purposes — including rights management, public funding, and broader visibility through open knowledge platforms.

This shared process would support data needs across: - collecting societies - cultural ministries - national statistical institutes - international databases like Wikidata or MusicBrainz - streaming and discovery services

The artist remains the source of truth. With proper consent and traceability, each registration contributes to a connected ecosystem.

![The composer Iris Szeghy was one of the first persons who allowed her data to be used in our shared register. With her example we show how the coordination or registration processes can lead to better music services for music users and researchers. See our presentation for the International Association of Music Information Centers.](png/skcmdb/iris_szeghy_identity.png){fig-align="center"}

This illustrates how a harmonised registration process can support both cultural recognition and reuse.

If you are a self-releasing artist or artist manager, you probably fill out dozens of registration forms each year — for databases, web platforms, grant applications, copyright management, and more. Over time, it's easy to lose track. And while you may forget these forms, your data doesn't: it lives on, often duplicated, outdated, or disconnected — scattered across the internet. It's a bit like space debris: years of untracked, obsolete data floating around. Each new registration risks colliding with the old unless registers are connected and responsibly maintained.

![Our systems allows a vertical data exchange, which allow that trusted, cooperating music organisations cross-check their data about artists and their works, recordings, releases, and then make them available for streaming providers, festival promoters, radio editors and other users.](png/omo/data_enrichment_dissemination.png)

The time has come for technology that connects these registers, returns control to the artist, and enables a single, authoritative point of truth for reliable, maintained data.

This system should not only save time for both artists and service providers, but also increase transparency, improve data quality, and support informed consent in the management of professional and personal information. In the longer term, it could enable regular reviews, help artists monitor where and how their data is used, and offer feedback on the quality and discoverability of their public profile.

![We use the European Interoperability Framework as a general conceptual guideline to create a multi-purpose, interoperable registration process.](png/eif/eif_4_layers_en_2x1.png)

This ambition builds on earlier research and practical experience, which we summarise in the next section.

## Preceding results from Open Music Europe WP1

This work builds on the statistical and methodological foundation laid by the `Open Music Europe` project. One of the project's central insights is that, although digital metadata about the music economy is increasingly abundant, core economic indicators — such as employment, income, and production investment — are still poorly captured in national and European statistics.

Two former deliverables helped map this gap. The first, a European-wide methodological assessment `D1.1` [@antal_et_al_music_economy_2023], presented in Bratislava in 2023, showed that fragmented data collection practices limit the use of standard economic codes such as `NACE` and `ISIC`. It recommended building open, artist-facing infrastructures that allow music professionals to register their data once and have it reused across multiple systems — for research, rights management, or policy analysis.

The second study [@antal_slovak-cult-stat-pilot], demonstrated how data could flow between music organisations, statistical offices, and national registers. It reused earlier national surveys — `KULT05`, `KULT16`, and `KULT19` — which had gathered useful information about music creators and organisations. However, those surveys lacked persistent identifiers and mechanisms for updates over time.

The `Slovak Music Economy Register` — developed under Task T1.2 — responds directly to this challenge. It aims to maintain a live, updateable register of music professionals and organisations, combining survey data, rights management records, and self-registered entries. It is part of the larger `Slovak Comprehensive Music Database` (SKCMDb), which also contains registers of musical works, sound recordings, and performance venues. Together, these connected datasets support better cultural statistics, rights attribution, and policy design.

By integrating sources like SOZA (the Slovak collective management organisation) and the Slovak Music Centre, the register creates a flexible but standards-compliant way to track economic activity in the music sector — one that respects national statistical needs while also supporting transparency, interoperability, and creator rights.

## Harmoinsed registers for better research data collection and statistical production

In statistical terms, a *register* is a structured list or database that systematically tracks units of interest—typically enterprises, individuals, or institutions—over time. Public statistical authorities often maintain *population registers* or *enterprise registers* that serve as the backbone for sampling, indicator production, and policy monitoring.

However, in many industries, particularly cultural and creative ones, official registers are incomplete or too broad, grouping diverse sectors under umbrella codes like NACE `J58` or `R90`. This is partly because the typical organisation size in these industries is smaller than the enterprise size that participates in traditional, mandatory sample-survey statistical production, and partly due to the high level of informality in these sectors, as reported in `T1.1` see [@antal_et_al_music_economy_2023; @antal_slovak-cult-stat-pilot]. These classifications dilute the specificity needed for meaningful data analysis. For instance, a music enterprise might be lumped together with film postproduction, making the resulting statistics less actionable for business decision-making or targeted public policy.

In contrast, private organisations often maintain richer, more detailed internal registers for their operations. These might include::

-   **Membership lists** maintained by professional associations or unions, such as those representing music publishing entities or record labels. For example, we created a Slovak register of music publishers; under the collective management directive\[@directive_2014_26\], such registers must be made public, even if not well-structured.

-   **Client databases** used by CMOs or licensing agencies, detailing entities like restaurants that play music. While these databases are proprietary, public business registers or local registers of licensed venues (e.g., restaurants, music clubs requiring local permission due to noise and traffic considerations) can help create connected music user registers.

-   **CRMs** (Customer Relationship Management systems) used by businesses for managing partners and contractors.

While these private registers are typically well-aligned with operational needs, they are not harmonised with national statistical systems—meaning identifiers (e.g., tax IDs, sector codes, geographic location data) may not match, formats vary, and there’s no common protocol for data structure or update frequency.

**Harmonisation**, in this context, does not mean full integration but rather the voluntary alignment of **key reference variables** and **metadata**:

-   Using public identifiers (e.g., business registry numbers),

-   Mapping internal categories to standard classifications like NACE or ISIC,

-   Agreeing on common reference periods and geographical codes.

With minimal effort, private actors can enhance the *statistical usability* of their data while still serving their internal purposes. This opens the door for *interoperability*, *cross-validation*, and more efficient data sharing—all without relinquishing control over proprietary data. We will illustrate these efforts in the next section of this document.

Efforts to harmonise registers across private and public actors also create the foundation for more advanced and resilient forms of **statistical production**. As previously noted, when data collection and processing can happen closer to the data source—whether through sampling, microdata preparation, or anonymised outputs—we reduce both privacy risks and operational burdens. This distributed model of statistical production reflects an important shift: the production of public value is no longer confined to the walls of official statistical offices but extended into the data infrastructures of cooperating institutions.

These changes are supported and legitimised by a growing ecosystem of **European data governance frameworks**, including the *Data Governance Ac* [@eu_data_governance_act_2021] and *Data Act* [@eu_data_act_2023], which encourage secure and fair reuse of privately held data for public interest purposes. More ambitiously, the development of **European Common Data Spaces**—such as the *Cultural Heritage Data Space* and upcoming *Media and Creative Industries Data Space*—aims to build sector-specific environments where data can be shared, pooled, and reused under common rules and interoperable standards. In *Open Music Europe*, we aim at the creation of a small, extendible music data space in the form of the *Open Music Observatory* that can federate data with other parts of the European data spaces.

Together, these legal, technical, and institutional innovations represent a new chapter in the co-production of knowledge: one where governments, cultural institutions, and private sector actors jointly curate the evidence base needed to shape smarter, more responsive policy.

## Data subjects or agents

In legal and statistical contexts, the term *data subject* refers to an individual or organization about whom data is collected. This framing emphasizes protection, privacy, and accountability—particularly in regulations such as the GDPR or frameworks for official statistics.

In our data model, we refer to these entities as *agents*. In ontology-based systems, agents are not just entities being measured—they are persons, groups, or organizations with the capacity to act. They can complete registration forms, report on past activities (like the number of performances), or update metadata about their professional roles.

This distinction is significant. Artists, ensembles, and institutions are not merely passive records in a database—they actively participate in creating, shaping, and maintaining information. Our register model supports this agency, ensuring that contributors are not just documented but empowered to influence how the ecosystem evolves.

Our primary data subjects possess copyrights or neighboring rights; our secondary focus includes other roles—often the same individuals in different capacities—who help commercialize and protect such rights.

-   **Natural persons**: Individuals involved in creating musical works (authors), recording musical works (producers and performers), or live performances (performers). We also consider roles such as music educators, publishers, distributors, and various managers within the music industry.

-   **Corporate bodies**: Groups formed by natural persons working together, such as musical ensembles, studios, publishers, labels, distributors, rights management agencies, archivists, librarians, and venues (both permanent like clubs and temporary like festivals).

Corporate bodies may incorporate and gain legal personality, allowing them to act as legal persons. However, the music and creative sectors often operate informally, with many corporate bodies unincorporated. Rights are frequently exercised by natural persons or their ever-changing groups, such as bands with fluctuating membership.

Methodologically, our data models refer to these subjects as "actors" or **agents**. While "actor" is a general term encompassing individuals and groups, including non-human entities like animals or software agents, our focus is on human agents, their groups, and corporations. We also record software agents that handle data for quality assurance and validation.

Our subjects are always human actors or agents—either living natural persons or deceased individuals. We do not collect information on fictional characters. Natural persons are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Deceased persons may have heirs who inherit rights; while GDPR no longer protects deceased individuals, other moral rights or data protection laws may apply.

Corporate bodies are groups of data subjects working together, often under a single name, like The Beatles or the Slovak Philharmonic. Managing corporate body data is challenging because membership in large bodies, like a philharmonic orchestra or a right collection agency, is changing almost daily.

: Corporate bodies as agents {tbl-colwidths="\[25,75\]"}

It is easier to work with corporate bodies if they are incorporated and gain legal personhood or similar legal recognition in the jurisdiction of a state. Data protection is still applicable, but not GDPR. Transparency laws make some of their data public. What is challenging in a highly informal sector like music is that corporate bodies and legal persons do not overlap in most cases.

## Forms of music or music entities

Our primary interest is not necessarily in the data subject but in their music, particularly their work (the occupation, artistic or economic activity they are engaged in) and its result in new music entities, such as works and their recorded and print manifestations. Copyrights and neighbouring rights connected to these entities, and their revenues. Event where and when these works are recorded or performed for an audience.

We are particularly interested in a parallel registration of works and the recorded fixations of their studio and staged performances intended for the public. (For example, we do not want to provide interoperability for recording information about rehearsals or liturgical uses of music for spiritual or faith-based communities.)

## Technical harmonisation

Private entities can enhance the statistical usability of their data with relatively small effort, maintaining their internal operational needs while enabling interoperability, cross-validation, and efficient data sharing. This approach allows for collaboration without compromising control over proprietary information. The Open Music Observatory and the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database (SKCMDb) exemplify innovative methods of semantic data integration, bridging statistics and private cultural data infrastructures.

We employ Wikibase, an open-source platform underpinning Wikidata, to create a "private Wikidata" environment. This setup offers high visibility, reusability, and collaborative potential. By leveraging a widely adopted, multilingual knowledge graph, we lower barriers to integration and reuse, benefiting statistical agencies and cultural researchers alike.

Mapping data from organizations such as SOZA, the Slovak Music Centre, the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, and the Slovak National Library to standard classifications like ESCO, SDMX, NACE, and ISCO establishes semantic connections between internal datasets and international frameworks. This strategy enhances statistical interoperability, supports multilingual capabilities, and facilitates automated updates, making the data more accessible and AI-ready.

The `Open Music Observatory` not only links music industry business data but also integrates cultural, labor, and economic dimensions. This comprehensive approach aligns with the objectives of cultural satellite accounts and Common Data Spaces initiatives. In this deliverable, we demonstrate how measuring the labor and cultural aspects of music can be supported through data infrastructures based on shared registration processes and harmonized registers.
