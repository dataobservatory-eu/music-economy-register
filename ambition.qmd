# Ambition: music registers that work together {#sec-ambition}

When somebody follows a registration process and registers a new person or thing into the register itself, they identify the subject and add some essential facts about it to a consistent document. In the modern world, such a register is almost always supported by a spreadsheet table or a relational database. Maintaining parallel registries to newer and newer purposes, digital services is a tedious, error-prone, and worrying practice. Artists, their groups, associations must give out more and more structured data without a full oversight or control over the process.

Our vision for a shared registration process entails a website where an artist can fill out one form all the necessary documents in a form and give appropriate GDPR consent for all essential services, and they can use this interface for maintenance and to some extend, withdrawal of data:

-   Register for rights management. This allows existing members to update or verify their data, and for non-members, it starts a membership or representation process.
-   When meeting the notability criteria, add the artist or artist group data to a national/regional music information services database.
-   Appear on open knowledge platforms like Wikipedia, Wikidata, or MusicBrainz.
-   A health check on all the data that the artist data needs to be represented on digital services, for example, on licensed streaming platforms.
-   Advice on the pros/cons of revealing information for visibility in autonomous systems (recommender algorithms of radios, streaming playlists, festival curation) and placing the selected information on open knowledge graphs where most digital services will automatically find the data. Placing the artists' or groups' data into a satellite register would improve the country's statistical register and allow the creation of better music statistics.

The resulting process should save time and effort for both the artists and their service providers, increase transparency and the level of informed consent regarding data handling, and allow the creation of better statistics, business, and music policy analysis. A similar procedure can be envisioned where the artist could review their data once a year, notify changes, and receive valuable, actionable feedback about how information travels about their work on the internet.

If you are a self-releasing artist or an artist's manager, it is likely that you fill out every year many registration forms for all sorts of databases, web applications, rights protection, grant proposals, and other purposes. It is likely that you have forgotten many of them; and you most certainly do not go back to all of these forms that you used in the past 10 years for registering to a service. Yet, the data from those registration forms lives somewhere. It may be on the Internet, it may be found others. There is a lot of outdated or incorrect data out there, beyond your control. It is a bit like space debris around the Earth: we have so many obsolete and broken satellites out there from the last 70 years that there is a high risk when you send up a new one, it will collide with an old. There is a growing need to find technology that connects these registers, gives back control to the artist or the artist management, and allows a single point of releasing authoritative, correct information.

![The composer Iris Szeghy was one of the first persons who allowed her data to be used in our shared register. With her example we show how the coordination or registration processes can lead to better music services for music users and researchers. See our presentation for the [International Association of Music Information Centers](https://reprex.nl/slides/20241121_iamic_vienna/).](png/skcmdb/iris_szeghy_identity.png){fig-align="center"}

In the `Open Music Europe` project, we are creating a limited joint register that can be extended to newer data fields. We will also show its benefits for promoting the local repertoire, increasing the efficiency of rights management, and improving the quality of music market, policy, or academic research.

Different music organisations register facts about various persons, their works, recordings or music events. They often carry out the registration steps, including identification and data checking parallel with the same subject, such as a music creator or a concert organiser. A rights management agency registers the creator and her work for paying royalties, and the librarian finds the book's printed version for lending. A concert organiser's event is registered in a music information centre to inform the potential audience and the rights management agency to distribute the composer's share from the staged event.

The parallel processes are usually largely manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. The person registering these facts may misspell a name or not recognise an ambiguous title that can refer to a different work or concert. After all, the most significant cost of a rights management agency is related to working with the registers to sort out all kinds of name and title ambiguity and find out who should be paid after specific music uses. Data entry and corrections are a large part of a librarian's work. Wouldn't it be easier if they were working in the same database?

![Our systems allows a vertical data exchange, which allow that trusted, cooperating music organisations cross-check their data about artists and their works, recordings, releases, and then make them available for streaming providers, festival promoters, radio editors and other users.](png/omo/data_enrichment_dissemination.png){fig-align="center"}

There are obvious benefits in harmonising registers, and it is a very current topic in legal, research, statistical, and business analytics data stewardships. However, the harmonisation of registration processes is more complex than it looks for data users unfamiliar with data management. In the past 20 years, many data centralisation programs have failed in music. It is beyond the scope of this report to explain why, but we recall here a few important lessons:

-   Different organisations work with the same facts but with different purposes and vocabulary and in other jobs and workflows. these differences then lead to very different and incompatible supporting data models.
-   The organisations often have a conflict of interest because they are targeting the same revenue sources, or the latecomers could free-ride on already occurred costs. haring work related to data management is not easy. Because of the many facets of the music sector, the different jobs and workflows of a rights manager, librarian, talent manager, researcher, archivist, distributor, statistician, or publisher, harmonisation of data management processes are inherently very complex.
-   Because of these complexities, even seemingly simple processes, such as registering the authorship of new music works and connecting the use of such works in recordings or libraries, are difficult.

## Multi-purpose register

![We use the European Interoperability Framework as a general conceptual guideline to create a multi-purpose, interoperable registration process.](png/eif/eif_4_layers_en_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

One of the most important lessons from the last 20 years of data centralisation failure is that it is a dead-end. We do not aim to centralise registers; we want to make them work together. Therefore, we switched our attention from databases to dataspace. Data (sharing) spaces are complex and intelligent systems that help connect databases in a way that can cross-reference, cross-validate and enrich each other. If the library recorded wrong information about a music work, it is also the rights management's interest to transfer the correct information from the rights management database to the library database.

## Harmoinsed registers for better research data collection and statistical production

In statistical terms, a **register** is a structured list or database that systematically tracks units of interest — typically enterprises, individuals, or institutions — over time. Public statistical authorities often maintain **population registers** or **enterprise registers** that serve as the backbone for sampling, indicator production, and policy monitoring.

However, in many industries, particularly cultural and creative ones, official registers are incomplete or too broad, grouping diverse sectors under umbrella codes like NACE `J58` or `R90`; partly, because the typical organisation size in these industries is smaller than the enterprise size that participates in the traditional, mandatory sample-survey statistical production, and partly because of the high level of informality in these sectors, as we have reported in `T1.1`, see [@antal_et_al_music_economy_2023; @antal_slovak-cult-stat-pilot].
These classifications dilute the specificity needed for meaningful data analysis following appropriate data collection. A music enterprise might be lumped together with film postproduction, making the resulting statistics less actionable for business decision-making or targeted public policy.

In contrast, private organisations often maintain richer, more detailed internal registers for their operations. These might include:

-   Membership lists maintained by professional associations or unions, for example, on music publishing entities representing copyrightholders, or record labels representing music producers and performers. We created a Slovak register of music publishers (by virtue of the collective management directive [-@directive_2014_26] such registers must be made public, even if in a not well structured form.)

-   Client databases used by CMOs or licensing agencies, for example, on restaurants that play music, on music publishing entities representing copyrightholders, or record labels representing music producers and performers. While client databases are properietary, from public business registers, or local registers of licensed venues (resturants, music clubs often need local permission because of the noise and traffic they create), we can create connected music user register. 

-   CRMs (customer relationship management systems) used by businesses for managing partners and contractors.

While these private registers are typically well-aligned with operational needs, they are not harmonised with national statistical systems — meaning identifiers (e.g. tax IDs, sector codes, geographic location data) may not match, formats vary, and there’s no common protocol for data structure or update frequency.

**Harmonisation**, in this context, does not mean full integration but rather the voluntary alignment of **key reference variables** and **metadata**:

-   Using public identifiers (e.g., business registry numbers),

-   Mapping internal categories to standard classifications like NACE or ISIC,

-   Agreeing on common reference periods and geographical codes.

With minimal effort, private actors can enhance the *statistical usability* of their data while still serving their internal purposes. This opens the door for *interoperability*, *cross-validation*, and more efficient data sharing — all without relinquishing control over proprietary data. We wil show these efforts in the next section of this document.

Efforts to harmonise registers across private and public actors also create the foundation for more advanced and resilient forms of **statistical production**. As previously noted, when data collection and processing can happen closer to the data source — whether through sampling, microdata preparation, or anonymised outputs — we reduce both privacy risks and operational burdens. This distributed model of statistical production reflects an important shift: the production of public value is no longer confined to the walls of official statistical offices, but extended into the data infrastructures of cooperating institutions.

These changes are not happening in isolation. They are supported and legitimised by a growing ecosystem of **European data governance frameworks**, including the *Data Governance Act* [-@eu_data_governance_act_2021] and *Data Act* [-@eu_data_act_2023], which encourage secure and fair reuse of privately held data for public interest purposes. More ambitiously, the development of **European Common Data Spaces** — such as the *Cultural Heritage Data Space* and upcoming *Media and Creative Industries Data Space* — aims to build sector-specific environments where data can be shared, pooled, and reused under common rules and interoperable standards. In *Open Music Europe*, we aim at the creation of a small, extendible music data space in the form of the *Open Music Observatory* that can federate data with other parts of the European data spaces. For instance, the *European Health Data Space (EHDS)* aims to create a unified framework for health data across EU member states. By standardizing data formats and access protocols, the EHDS enhances the interoperability of health registers, ensuring seamless data sharing and improved healthcare outcomes.

Together, these legal, technical, and institutional innovations represent a new chapter in the co-production of knowledge: one where governments, cultural institutions, and private sector actors jointly curate the evidence base needed to shape smarter, more responsive policy.

## Data subjects or agents

A statistical or data subject is an individual or a corporate body to whom the personal data relates; but we will. In our registration processes, we will deal with the various data subjects.

In our data model (described in another document) we call these actors agents. In various standard data models and their broader, IT-system-independent conceptualisations an agent is a person, group, or organization that takes action, creates, influences, or is responsible for something within a given context. We register agents in the context of music, with a special emphasis on agents who participate in another registration process: the registration of works, sound recordings, print music, or the first live performance of a work.

Our primary data subjects have copyrights or neighbouring rights; our secondary targets are other subjects (often the same people wearing different hats) who help commercialise and protect such rights.

-   `Natural persons` who participate in the creation of musical works (authors), the recorded fixation of musical works (producers and performers), the live performance of musical work that is open for the audience (performers), or simply, "musicians". We have a secondary interest in natural persons, often the same people in different roles, such as music educators, publishers, distributors, and various live performance, label, and tour managers.

-   `Corporate bodies` are forms of the natural persons registered in our system and work together: musical groups (ensembles, orchestras, bands, duos, trios ...), rehearsal, radio, recording and other studios, publishers, labels, distributors, rights management agencies, archivists, librarians, documentalists—permanent music venues like clubs, and temporary ones like festivals and arenas.

Corporate bodies often incorporate themselves and gain a legal personality. We can talk about a music publisher as one person because it can act as a legal person. In many sectors of the economy, corporate bodies are almost always incorporated. Some sectors, like banking or insurance, must be contained in a particular way. These are the sectors that are highly formalised. Music and the creative sectors are on the other end of the spectrum: it is highly informal, meaning many corporate bodies are not incorporated. Natural persons or their ever-changing groups exercise many rights. Bands and ensembles are such groups where membership can change quite frequently.

Methodologically, our data models call these subjects "actors" or "**agents**". The actors are a general term that covers individuals and groups, humans and other biological actors, such as animals. Agents also cover software agents that act on behalf of humans. Our focus is on human agents, their groups, and corporations; we will also record software agents dealing with their data for quality assurance and validation.

Our subjects are always human actors or agents; they are natural persons, or they are deceased natural persons. (We do not collect information on fictional characters.) Natural persons are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Deceased persons may have heirs who inherited rights and are natural persons, too. GDPR no longer protects deceased persons; other moral rights or data protection may apply to them.

Corporate bodies are groups of data subjects working together, often under a single name, like The Beatles or the Slovak Philharmonic. Managing corporate body data is challenging because membership in large bodies, like a philharmonic orchestra or a right collection agency, is changing almost daily.

: Corporate bodies as agents {tbl-colwidths="\[25,75\]"}

It is easier to work with corporate bodies if they are incorporated and gain legal personhood or similar legal recognition in the jurisdiction of a state. Data protection is still applicable, but not GDPR. Transparency laws make some of their data public. What is challenging in a highly informal sector like music is that corporate bodies and legal persons do not overlap in most cases.

## Forms of music or music entities

Our primary interest is not necessarily in the data subject but in their music, particularly their work (the occupation, artistic or economic activity they are engaged in) and its result in new music entities, such as works and their recorded and print manifestations. Copyrights and neighbouring rights connected to these entities, and their revenues. Event where and when these works are recorded or performed for an audience.

We are particularly interested in a parallel registration of works and the recorded fixations of their studio and staged performances intended for the public. (For example, we do not want to provide interoperability for recording information about rehearsals or liturgical uses of music for spiritual or faith-based communities.)

## Technical harmonisation

With relatively small effort, private actors can enhance the statistical usability of their data while still serving their internal purposes. This opens the door for interoperability, cross-validation, and more efficient data sharing — all without relinquishing control over proprietary data. The `Open Music Observatory` and the `Slovak Comprehensive Music Database` (SKCMDb) are showcasing the novel ways of semantic data integration for statistics and (mainly private) cultural data infrastructure.

- We use Wikibase (a "private Wikidata"), well-harmonised with the world's most extensive knowledge graph, Wikidata gives very high level of visibility, reusability, and collaboration. It leverages a widely used, open, and multilingual knowledge graph, lowering entry barriers for integration and reuse by others — including statistical agencies and cultural researchers.

Mapping CMO data and heritage data from SOZA, the Slovak Music Centre, the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, and the Slovak National Library to standard classifications like ESCO, SDMX, NACE, and ISCO creates valuable semantic bridges between internal data and international frameworks. This enhances not only statistical interoperability, but also AI-readiness, multilingual support, and the capacity for automated updates.


- The `Open Music Observatory` is not only linking music industry business data, but also tying it to cultural, labour, and economic dimensions — exactly the type of integration the cultural satellite accounts and Common Data Spaces initiatives are aiming for. In this deliverable we show how measuring labour and cultural dimensions of music can be supported with the data infrastructure that rests on shared registration processes and registers.
