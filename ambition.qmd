# Ambition: music registers that work together {#sec-ambition}

When someone registers a new person or entity in a system, they are identifying a subject and attaching key facts about them to a consistent record. Today, such records are almost always managed through spreadsheet tables or relational databases. However, as digital services multiply, maintaining parallel registries for every new purpose has become a tedious, error-prone, and increasingly problematic practice. Artists, their groups, and their associations are asked to submit more and more structured data — often without full oversight or control over where and how this information is stored or reused.

Our vision is a **shared registration process**: a unified platform where an artist can fill out a single form to submit the necessary data and documents, grant GDPR-compliant consent, and manage their information over time. Through this interface, they could register and maintain data for multiple purposes, such as:

-   Rights management: verify or update existing data, or initiate membership or representation with a collecting society.

-   Inclusion in national or regional music information databases, once notability criteria are met.

-   Appearances on open knowledge platforms such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, or MusicBrainz.

-   Health checks to ensure that their metadata is correctly structured for use by licensed streaming services and other digital platforms.

-   Guidance on visibility trade-offs — what data to share and where — especially with regard to discovery by recommendation systems (e.g., radio, streaming playlists, festival curation), and how to place selected information into open knowledge graphs.

-   Contribution to satellite registers that enhance the national statistical system and support the development of more accurate and timely music industry statistics.

Such a process would not only save time for both artists and service providers but also increase **transparency**, **improve data quality**, and support **informed consent** in the management of personal and professional information. In the longer term, we envision a system where artists can review their data annually, flag changes, and receive valuable, actionable feedback on how their information is used across the digital ecosystem.

If you are a self-releasing artist or artist manager, you probably fill out **dozens of registration forms** each year — for databases, web platforms, grant applications, copyright management, and more. Over time, it’s easy to lose track. And while you may forget these forms, your data doesn’t: it lives on, often duplicated, outdated, or disconnected — scattered across the internet. It’s a bit like space debris: years of untracked, obsolete data floating around, and each new registration risks colliding with the old. The time has come for technology that **connects these registers**, returns control to the artist, and enables a **single, authoritative point of truth** for releasing and maintaining accurate information.

![The composer Iris Szeghy was one of the first persons who allowed her data to be used in our shared register. With her example we show how the coordination or registration processes can lead to better music services for music users and researchers. See our presentation for the [International Association of Music Information Centers](https://reprex.nl/slides/20241121_iamic_vienna/).](png/skcmdb/iris_szeghy_identity.png){fig-align="center"}

In the `Open Music Europe` project, we are creating a limited joint register that can be extended to newer data fields. We will also show its benefits for promoting the local repertoire, increasing the efficiency of rights management, and improving the quality of music market, policy, or academic research.

Different music organisations register facts about various persons, their works, recordings or music events. They often carry out the registration steps, including identification and data checking parallel with the same subject, such as a music creator or a concert organiser. A rights management agency registers the creator and her work for paying royalties, and the librarian finds the book's printed version for lending. A concert organiser's event is registered in a music information centre to inform the potential audience and the rights management agency to distribute the composer's share from the staged event.

The parallel processes are usually largely manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. The person registering these facts may misspell a name or not recognise an ambiguous title that can refer to a different work or concert. After all, the most significant cost of a rights management agency is related to working with the registers to sort out all kinds of name and title ambiguity and find out who should be paid after specific music uses. Data entry and corrections are a large part of a librarian's work. Wouldn't it be easier if they were working in the same database?

![Our systems allows a vertical data exchange, which allow that trusted, cooperating music organisations cross-check their data about artists and their works, recordings, releases, and then make them available for streaming providers, festival promoters, radio editors and other users.](png/omo/data_enrichment_dissemination.png){fig-align="center"}

There are obvious benefits in harmonising registers, and it is a very current topic in legal, research, statistical, and business analytics data stewardships. However, the harmonisation of registration processes is more complex than it looks for data users unfamiliar with data management. In the past 20 years, many data centralisation programs have failed in music. It is beyond the scope of this report to explain why, but we recall here a few important lessons:

-   Different organisations work with the same facts but with different purposes and vocabulary and in other jobs and workflows. these differences then lead to very different and incompatible supporting data models.
-   The organisations often have a conflict of interest because they are targeting the same revenue sources, or the latecomers could free-ride on already occurred costs. haring work related to data management is not easy. Because of the many facets of the music sector, the different jobs and workflows of a rights manager, librarian, talent manager, researcher, archivist, distributor, statistician, or publisher, harmonisation of data management processes are inherently very complex.
-   Because of these complexities, even seemingly simple processes, such as registering the authorship of new music works and connecting the use of such works in recordings or libraries, are difficult.

## Multi-purpose register

![We use the European Interoperability Framework as a general conceptual guideline to create a multi-purpose, interoperable registration process.](png/eif/eif_4_layers_en_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

One of the most important lessons from the last 20 years of data centralisation failure is that it is a dead-end. We do not aim to centralise registers; we want to make them work together. Therefore, we switched our attention from databases to dataspace. Data (sharing) spaces are complex and intelligent systems that help connect databases in a way that can cross-reference, cross-validate and enrich each other. If the library recorded wrong information about a music work, it is also the rights management's interest to transfer the correct information from the rights management database to the library database.

## Harmoinsed registers for better research data collection and statistical production

In statistical terms, a **register** is a structured list or database that systematically tracks units of interest — typically enterprises, individuals, or institutions — over time. Public statistical authorities often maintain **population registers** or **enterprise registers** that serve as the backbone for sampling, indicator production, and policy monitoring.

However, in many industries, particularly cultural and creative ones, official registers are incomplete or too broad, grouping diverse sectors under umbrella codes like NACE `J58` or `R90`; partly, because the typical organisation size in these industries is smaller than the enterprise size that participates in the traditional, mandatory sample-survey statistical production, and partly because of the high level of informality in these sectors, as we have reported in `T1.1`, see [@antal_et_al_music_economy_2023; @antal_slovak-cult-stat-pilot]. These classifications dilute the specificity needed for meaningful data analysis following appropriate data collection. A music enterprise might be lumped together with film postproduction, making the resulting statistics less actionable for business decision-making or targeted public policy.

In contrast, private organisations often maintain richer, more detailed internal registers for their operations. These might include:

-   Membership lists maintained by professional associations or unions, for example, on music publishing entities representing copyrightholders, or record labels representing music producers and performers. We created a Slovak register of music publishers (by virtue of the collective management directive [-@directive_2014_26] such registers must be made public, even if in a not well structured form.)

-   Client databases used by CMOs or licensing agencies, for example, on restaurants that play music, on music publishing entities representing copyrightholders, or record labels representing music producers and performers. While client databases are properietary, from public business registers, or local registers of licensed venues (resturants, music clubs often need local permission because of the noise and traffic they create), we can create connected music user register.

-   CRMs (customer relationship management systems) used by businesses for managing partners and contractors.

While these private registers are typically well-aligned with operational needs, they are not harmonised with national statistical systems — meaning identifiers (e.g. tax IDs, sector codes, geographic location data) may not match, formats vary, and there’s no common protocol for data structure or update frequency.

**Harmonisation**, in this context, does not mean full integration but rather the voluntary alignment of **key reference variables** and **metadata**:

-   Using public identifiers (e.g., business registry numbers),

-   Mapping internal categories to standard classifications like NACE or ISIC,

-   Agreeing on common reference periods and geographical codes.

With minimal effort, private actors can enhance the *statistical usability* of their data while still serving their internal purposes. This opens the door for *interoperability*, *cross-validation*, and more efficient data sharing — all without relinquishing control over proprietary data. We wil show these efforts in the next section of this document.

Efforts to harmonise registers across private and public actors also create the foundation for more advanced and resilient forms of **statistical production**. As previously noted, when data collection and processing can happen closer to the data source — whether through sampling, microdata preparation, or anonymised outputs — we reduce both privacy risks and operational burdens. This distributed model of statistical production reflects an important shift: the production of public value is no longer confined to the walls of official statistical offices, but extended into the data infrastructures of cooperating institutions.

These changes are not happening in isolation. They are supported and legitimised by a growing ecosystem of **European data governance frameworks**, including the *Data Governance Act* [-@eu_data_governance_act_2021] and *Data Act* [-@eu_data_act_2023], which encourage secure and fair reuse of privately held data for public interest purposes. More ambitiously, the development of **European Common Data Spaces** — such as the *Cultural Heritage Data Space* and upcoming *Media and Creative Industries Data Space* — aims to build sector-specific environments where data can be shared, pooled, and reused under common rules and interoperable standards. In *Open Music Europe*, we aim at the creation of a small, extendible music data space in the form of the *Open Music Observatory* that can federate data with other parts of the European data spaces. For instance, the *European Health Data Space (EHDS)* aims to create a unified framework for health data across EU member states. By standardizing data formats and access protocols, the EHDS enhances the interoperability of health registers, ensuring seamless data sharing and improved healthcare outcomes.

Together, these legal, technical, and institutional innovations represent a new chapter in the co-production of knowledge: one where governments, cultural institutions, and private sector actors jointly curate the evidence base needed to shape smarter, more responsive policy.

## Data subjects or agents

A statistical or data subject is an individual or a corporate body to whom the personal data relates; but we will. In our registration processes, we will deal with the various data subjects.

In our data model (described in another document) we call these actors agents. In various standard data models and their broader, IT-system-independent conceptualisations an agent is a person, group, or organization that takes action, creates, influences, or is responsible for something within a given context. We register agents in the context of music, with a special emphasis on agents who participate in another registration process: the registration of works, sound recordings, print music, or the first live performance of a work.

Our primary data subjects have copyrights or neighbouring rights; our secondary targets are other subjects (often the same people wearing different hats) who help commercialise and protect such rights.

-   `Natural persons` who participate in the creation of musical works (authors), the recorded fixation of musical works (producers and performers), the live performance of musical work that is open for the audience (performers), or simply, "musicians". We have a secondary interest in natural persons, often the same people in different roles, such as music educators, publishers, distributors, and various live performance, label, and tour managers.

-   `Corporate bodies` are forms of the natural persons registered in our system and work together: musical groups (ensembles, orchestras, bands, duos, trios ...), rehearsal, radio, recording and other studios, publishers, labels, distributors, rights management agencies, archivists, librarians, documentalists—permanent music venues like clubs, and temporary ones like festivals and arenas.

Corporate bodies often incorporate themselves and gain a legal personality. We can talk about a music publisher as one person because it can act as a legal person. In many sectors of the economy, corporate bodies are almost always incorporated. Some sectors, like banking or insurance, must be contained in a particular way. These are the sectors that are highly formalised. Music and the creative sectors are on the other end of the spectrum: it is highly informal, meaning many corporate bodies are not incorporated. Natural persons or their ever-changing groups exercise many rights. Bands and ensembles are such groups where membership can change quite frequently.

Methodologically, our data models call these subjects "actors" or "**agents**". The actors are a general term that covers individuals and groups, humans and other biological actors, such as animals. Agents also cover software agents that act on behalf of humans. Our focus is on human agents, their groups, and corporations; we will also record software agents dealing with their data for quality assurance and validation.

Our subjects are always human actors or agents; they are natural persons, or they are deceased natural persons. (We do not collect information on fictional characters.) Natural persons are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Deceased persons may have heirs who inherited rights and are natural persons, too. GDPR no longer protects deceased persons; other moral rights or data protection may apply to them.

Corporate bodies are groups of data subjects working together, often under a single name, like The Beatles or the Slovak Philharmonic. Managing corporate body data is challenging because membership in large bodies, like a philharmonic orchestra or a right collection agency, is changing almost daily.

: Corporate bodies as agents {tbl-colwidths="\[25,75\]"}

It is easier to work with corporate bodies if they are incorporated and gain legal personhood or similar legal recognition in the jurisdiction of a state. Data protection is still applicable, but not GDPR. Transparency laws make some of their data public. What is challenging in a highly informal sector like music is that corporate bodies and legal persons do not overlap in most cases.

## Forms of music or music entities

Our primary interest is not necessarily in the data subject but in their music, particularly their work (the occupation, artistic or economic activity they are engaged in) and its result in new music entities, such as works and their recorded and print manifestations. Copyrights and neighbouring rights connected to these entities, and their revenues. Event where and when these works are recorded or performed for an audience.

We are particularly interested in a parallel registration of works and the recorded fixations of their studio and staged performances intended for the public. (For example, we do not want to provide interoperability for recording information about rehearsals or liturgical uses of music for spiritual or faith-based communities.)

## Technical harmonisation

With relatively small effort, private actors can enhance the statistical usability of their data while still serving their internal purposes. This opens the door for interoperability, cross-validation, and more efficient data sharing — all without relinquishing control over proprietary data. The `Open Music Observatory` and the `Slovak Comprehensive Music Database` (SKCMDb) are showcasing the novel ways of semantic data integration for statistics and (mainly private) cultural data infrastructure.

-   We use Wikibase (a "private Wikidata"), well-harmonised with the world's most extensive knowledge graph, Wikidata gives very high level of visibility, reusability, and collaboration. It leverages a widely used, open, and multilingual knowledge graph, lowering entry barriers for integration and reuse by others — including statistical agencies and cultural researchers.

Mapping CMO data and heritage data from SOZA, the Slovak Music Centre, the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, and the Slovak National Library to standard classifications like ESCO, SDMX, NACE, and ISCO creates valuable semantic bridges between internal data and international frameworks. This enhances not only statistical interoperability, but also AI-readiness, multilingual support, and the capacity for automated updates.

-   The `Open Music Observatory` is not only linking music industry business data, but also tying it to cultural, labour, and economic dimensions — exactly the type of integration the cultural satellite accounts and Common Data Spaces initiatives are aiming for. In this deliverable we show how measuring labour and cultural dimensions of music can be supported with the data infrastructure that rests on shared registration processes and registers.
