## Value of the Data

::: callout-note
Music registers are necessary for correctly administrating copyrights and their neighbouring rights, accounting for music on corporate and national levels, and surveying business or artistic activities. This database and its documentation show a novel way of creating a multi-purpose superregister that connects private and public registers.
:::

## Background

::: callout-note
The economic measurement of music and the administration of copyrights and neighbouring rights suffer from a lack of coordination among registers. Such problems persist on the level of national accounts and their cultural satellite accounts on a statistical level as well as on the micro-level of keeping records of authors', producers' and performers' royalties. In *Open Music Europe* we aim to provide solutions to improve data collection with novel registers.
:::

"A register aims to be a complete list of the objects in a specific group of objects or population." [@anders_register-based_2007] Norway created statistical registers to tap into governmental data stores in 1990 and into municipal ones in 1995; by 2019, it utilised about 100 records and drew data from 30 public institutional sources [@saebo_new_data_sources_2023, p1]. Like most countries, such "administrative data" was retrieved from other governmental entities, not the private sector. Collecting data from people, companies, and non-profits still relies on census-like comprehensive and sample surveys that take the form of filling out a digital or paper format or answering questions to an interviewer who fills out the form instead of the respondent.

Surveying is costly and often inaccurate. Asking randomly selected music creators about their received royalties over a year requires the respondent to answer questions after opening and reviewing various royalty statements or necessarily filters through the individual's cognitive biases and memory lapses. `Statistics Norway` realised that instead of asking 7000 households about what they were buying in the supermarkets, it is far more accurate and potentially cheaper to acquire the data directly from the sales logs of the supermarkets or the payment transaction records of the credit card companies. CEEMID, the predecessor of `Open Music Europe`, relied on similar techniques that experimenting government statisticians used: we kept asking anonymously and randomly music creators about their received royalties, but we also compared the data with the actual anonymised payouts of Artisjus in Hungary and SOZA in Slovakia.

The lessons of Norway are interesting because the new statistical law (in force since 2021) allows such data collection after a cost/benefit analysis and risk reduction carried out by `Statistics Norway`. Norway, like all EFTA countries and Eurostat participates in ESS and applies the same statistical EU/EEA regulations that Slovakia, Bulgaria or Hungary applies. While in `Open Music Europe`, we are not planning and not even advocating state-mandated data collection; we find these criteria useful for voluntary data sharing with the government based on individual agreements, which we endorse in the music sector.

## Collection statement

::: callout-note
We are registering entities of *music works* and *sound recordings* (in statistical terms, music products), the populations are *music authors*, *music performers*, *groupings of performers* (as the majority of the musicians perform, record, release in groups, ensembles, orchestras), *record labels* (which may be formal and informal businesses) and *music publishers* (enterprises.)
:::

From a statistical point of view, our planned music industry registers can be seen as "administrative registers" because they were not initially created for a statistical purpose by a statistical authority.

The statistical business register is an essential tool for creating survey frames or sample frames, in other words, to organise statistical data collection. In non-technical terms, this register is necessary to decide who should get a data request.

-   For a *sample survey*, the register is used to draw a lottery of those members of the population who will be invited to provide data.

-   In a *census*-type survey, all registered members of the population, for example, all music labels, will receive an invitation to an interview or form.

-   In the case of *a register-based survey*, all members of the register, for example, all collective management societies in the territory, will be requested to send data directly from their databases.

The Universe and the Coverage of the survey is a group of agents (humans or corporate bodies). When we survey orchestras, the universe is all the orchestras that conform to our universe definition (musical groups that have performed at least one concert in the timespan in Slovakia.) That is in itself a subgroup of those musical groups that were inactive in the timespan.

### General model of agency

Agents, like persons, their groups and corporate bodies, create material entities, start processes, participate in events. Our model has a high-level interoperability because it models agency similar to rather foundational ontologies that are re-used in \[the field of music\] in \[ \].

One unusual element of a register that administers copyrights is that it contains data on deceased people and their heirs because the economic rights embedded in copyrights have a protection term beyond the author's death, and they are inherited. Consequently, a copyright register contains people who are neither composers, producers or performers of music but heirs without any music-related occupation. Some royalty payments leave the universe of living artists and go to heirs.

### Informal corporate bodies: orchestras, informal enterprises

Groups are connected to humans. For example, to register an orchestra into VIAF, the register of national libraries, we must give an inception date and the founding members.

::: callout-note
*The Beatles* evolved in 1960 from John Lennon's previous group, the *Quarrymen* (predecessor), and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, starting in 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962.

*The Beatles* has an inception in 1960 with four members: Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, and Best. In 1962, before their first commercial release, Best is replaced by Starr. All studio recording releases define The Beatles as a group of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr, however, after the dissolution of the band in 1969-1970, several recordings were released to the public that were recorded originally before 1962. Therefore, there are some known Beatles recordings where Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Best form the group.
:::

Orchestras and bands that do not perform only in an amateur, educational or liturgical function must be able to receive payments for their performances. It is necessary that the musical group as a corporate body is linked to an entity that can issue invoice and account for the revenues and their taxes.

### Musicians works and recordings

The purpose of our surveying register is to help to collect data on the agents of music. We develop our register in a way that human agents in composer, producer and performing roles can be connected to their works, recorded, print and live public performance manifestations. We will show our work and manifestation register in a separate document.

### Formal corporate bodies: municipalities, enterprises, foundations

Concert promoters are usually easier to observe than orchestras, but their form varies. They can be enterprises with an economic activity (classified with a NACE code), NGOs, or public bodies, such as municipalities. Concert promoters are found in several state registers, and crucially, they should be found in the licensing database of author's societies. Only those concert promoters who put on stage out-of-copyright or exclusively liturgical music (in churches, synagogues, etc.) are exempted.

The concert producers (as orchestras) should be somewhere in the register of enterprises or sole proprietors, but finding them is looking for a needle in the hay. They may use a company of one of the members for this purpose, which has an entirely independent main economic activity from R90 performing arts. We will show the difficulties of capturing live music events with the hypothetical example of Amber Smith, a band, playing in a free show of organised by Nagymaros, a municipality. The members of Amber Smith do get paid.

#### Concert economics: supply side

There is a band called Ambersmith (band). It is a corporate body in CIDOC-CRM, an agent in DCTERMS.

The band has a corporate body, Ambersmith Kft. that is a legal entity. It is owned by the members of Ambersmith (band)

The Ambersmith Kft. has main economic activity of Performing Arts.

If we want to measure concert economics, we need to be able the payment transaction connected to the payer or the payee.

If we want to measure concert economics, we need to be able to see the payment transaction connected to the payer or the payee.

Who may have a record with both agents (payer and payee?). The author's rights organisations must license this public music performance so they have information about both the payee and the payer.

#### Concert economics: demand side

There is a corporate body, the municipality of `Nagymaros`.

`Nagymaros` organises an Event called "Free Concert".

`Nagymaros` pays for the performance of `Ambersmith (band)` to `Ambersmith Kft.`

A potential complication is that actually a non-profit company owned by the municipality, `Nagymaros Cultural Events Non-Profit Kft` pays the `Ambersmith Kft.`.

The connection between the live music production (Amber Smith and Ambersmith Kft) and the staging of the music (Nagymaros municipality and its non-profit cultural entity) are connected in space and time if Artisjus, the Hungarian collective rights management agency, licenses. In this case, the licensing database contains both important Agents, the time, space, and likely some other variables like maximum capacity of the location, if the event is ticketed or not, if ticketed, and what the ticket price is.

## Experimental design, materials and methods

::: callout-note
Our connected registers are, to our knowledge, unique; they utilise recently novel statistical production and legal regulatory innovations to connect public and private registers. Our database's data governance and exchange are unique because of the serious data protection restrictions posed by the use of both public statistical and private registers.
:::

A *statistical register* is a continuously or regularly updated set of objects for a given population. It contains information on the identification and accessibility of population units as well as other attributes which support the surveying process of the population. It serves as a constantly updated list of potential data sources: people or enterprises, for example, who may be invited to a sample survey or a census. The statistical register is both a coordination tool for data collection (everybody is found who should provide data), and an important data quality management tool (we know if somebody was not found, how it will distort our resulting datasets.) For example, as earlier stated, `Statistics Norway` applies about 100 statistical registers.

Our primary concern in Slovakia is the creation of a music business register, because this could provide indicators for the public policy-level and institutional/enterprise level implementation of the Slovak cultural strategy.

The authoritative source on statistical business registers is the *United Nations Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers. Final draft prior to official editing* [@un_sbr_guidelines_2020] which is heavily based on the former UNECE *Guidelines on statistical business registers* [@unece_sbr_guidelines_2015]. The European guideline is the *European business statistics methodological manual for statistical business registers. 2021 edition* [@eurostat_sbr_manual_2021].





## Data Access

Currently access to the database is possible via <https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/index.php?title=Main_Page> on a password-protected website. After further checks and improvements we will release the datasets for everybody on an open platform. This dataset is stored in a graph database, and it has full interoperability. We created simplified datasets that can be viewed with a simple spreadsheet software, but they are not ideal for machine-use.

# Data Curation Policy for SKCMDb

**1. Introduction** The creators of SKCMDb are committed to maintaining high-quality, accurate, and reliable data for research and analysis. This policy outlines the principles and processes governing the curation, management, and dissemination of data within the database.

**2. Data Scope and Coverage** The database curates and maintains data relevant to researching the comparative history of textile and fashion of the Latgale region of Latvia. It includes primary data on historical garments, and linked data on provenance location, time, and metadata necessary for reproducibility, enrichment, updating, and analysis. (See ontologies, taxonomies, and controlled vocabularies used below.)

The dataset contains the properties (in columns) of observations of historical garments (in rows). Categorical information, such as type of use of the garment, the method of creation, etc. are used by a classification system.

The classification is performed by the researcher (currently Ieva Pigozne), using standard classes from museum, library, open scientific repository and open knowledge ontologies described later, with the examples presented in the first table. This classification also utilises taxonomies, primarily the AAT (internationally used for art history) and Geonames (for place names.)

`SKCMDb`, which contains these dataset, is technically stored in a MariaDB database extended for graph format with Wikibase. Wikibase, the software that powers Wikidata, the world's largest open graph database, has been successfully used in the past decade to create interoperable library services [@van_veen_wikidata_2019; @bianchini_beyond_2021; @sardo_wikidata_2022], museum services [@pfeiffer_representing_2021], and archives (references), and creating interoperability among the institutional silos of these three types of heritage collections [@alexiev_bulgarian_2020; @rossenova_wikidata_2022]. EU institutions themselves also use it [@semic_2020_providing_2020].

### Data Collection and Ingestion

#### Primary data sources
The population register is the primary data source for labour surveys and other personal surveys in the Slovak Republic. Researchers cannot access this register directly.

For **Human** agents, we use 
- [ ] the database of SOZA, which contains all living and deceased persons known to hold copyrights in Slovakia in relational database tables;
- [x] the database of the Slovak Music Centre, which contains information about living and deceased human persons as composers and performers (including music directors or conductors) and educators in relational database tables;
-  [x] Wikipedia contains data about notable human agents in a loosely structured form of narrative encyclopaedic entries.
- [x] wikidata contains data about notable human agents in graph format.
- [ ] The database(s) of sole proprietors who are registered to conduct regular business activities and may be registered for European community VAT transactions. We are still investigating the legal implications of using this data source.


For **Corporate bodies**
-  [x] The registered music publishers are in the SOZA database.
-  [x] the database of the Slovak Music Centre, which contains information on certain musical groups
-  [x] The registration data of IFPI Czechia and Slovakia.
-  [x] The company house register of the Slovak Republic.
-  [x] The statistical register of the KULT surveys in the Slovak Republic for orchestras, record labels, and concert venue operators.
-  [x] OpenCorporates.

For **Events**, we are are only experimenting with the connection of the following data sources:

-  [x] The concert calendar of the Slovak Music Centre. Historical data on events from the Slovak Music Centre.
-  [ ] The non-public licensing database of SOZA that contains information about licensed music events.

For **Places**, we are only experimenting with the connection of concert venues with actual events, and participating music performers and concert promoters.

-  [x] The concert calendar of the Slovak Music Centre for locations. Historical location data on events from the Slovak Music Centre.
-  [ ] The non-public licensing database of SOZA that contains information about the location of public performance venues.

### Limitations
::: callout-note
Our register contains data about living and deceased natural persons and informal and formal corporate bodies. The legal requirements to use the data vary; the use of human data subjects is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union, among other regulations.
:::


The SOZA membership register is not directly accessible. However, it is accessible to send out a survey to the people registered on this list no more than once a year. The statistical properties of the registered humans (such as the number of registered living persons, mean or average age, and distribution of certain income) are available for testing survey coverage. For example, it is possible to test how closely anonymous responses in a survey correlate with the actual target population (universe), i.e., to test the representative coverage within the anonymised survey responses.

### Data Quality and Integrity

-   Data undergoes regular validation and integrity checks to ensure accuracy. This includes human validation by Ieva Pigozne as a textile researcher, and integrity checks by the data stewards.

-   Version control is implemented to track changes and updates; each published new version received a version-DOI on Zenodo.

-   Erroneous or obsolete data is flagged, corrected, or archived appropriately.

### Data Ontologies, Taxonomies, and Enrichment

The database employs standardized ontologies and taxonomies to ensure consistency and interoperability. These ontologies and taxonomies were selected for

*Here describe ontologies.*

Metadata schemas and controlled vocabularies are used to enhance data organization and discoverability.

-   Our primary interoperability target is museum applications, so we use the CIDOC-CRM ontology [@cidoc_2024], abbreviated in this document with the `crm` prefix.

-   Our secondary interoperability target is with library applications for cross-referencing research and data that cites the objects in the collections. We use the Dublin Core library ontology, DCTERMS for this purpose [@dublin_core_dcmi_2020], abbreviated with the `dcterms` prefix in this document. DCTERMS provides a wide interoperability with data repositories, as they often use DCTERMS as their foundation ontology.

-   Our third interoperability target is DataCite, which is the preferred ontology for European open science repositories.

For ensuring that researchers and their software applications understand our descriptions the same way the descriptions of garments and their provenance information, we use the following controlled vocabularies.

-   For describing the classification of garments and their production techniques, we use the AAT \[citation\], a widely used thesaurus for art collections.

-   For describing places (of original provenance and current hold locations), we use Geonames, a global taxonomy of place names.

-   We use Wikidata for identifying institutions, but also, when it has clear equivalence with AAT or Geonames, we provide Wikidata QIDs for greater interoperability.

-   Automated and manual data enrichment techniques, such as entity linking and annotation, are applied to improve data usability.

### Data Updates and Maintenance

-   The database is updated on a regular basis, with at least one update in every quarter (three months.) We may update more frequently if we acquire significant new data.

-   Changes in data sources or methodologies are documented transparently.

-   Regular audits are conducted to identify and resolve inconsistencies.

### Data Access and Sharing

-   Data is made available under an open access policy on the Zenodo open science data repository and in Reprex's Textilebase database.

-   Users must comply with licensing and ethical guidelines when using data, particularly with providing proper attribution to the authors, data managers and data stewards of the dataset.

-   Citation and attribution of data sources are required for publication and dissemination. Please cite the dataset as \[xxxxx\]

### Data Security and Privacy

-   We do not handle personal data, with the exception of adding names of data curators, researchers, who must be attributed as creators of the dataset.

-   Access to our datasets is not strictly controlled, however, only the dataset placed in the Zenodo scientific repository is authentic for re-use. We use Zenodo to create an independent, trusted, authoritative copy of the dataset with versions, identified by a new DOI for each new version.

### Governance and Responsibilities

We follow the dataspace concept in building SKCMDb. A dataspace is an emerging approach to data management which recognises that in large-scale integration scenarios involving many partners, it would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to obtain an upfront unifying schema across all sources or to come to a legal agreement on the terms of using or exchanging the data. It is an intelligent application that allows a near-instantaneous exchange, processing, sharing and provision of data on an âas-neededâ or âas-permittedâ basis while retaining complete control of each data holder over the conditions (e.g., who, when, and under what condition) of access to their data [@curry_dataspaces_2020; @dataspace_for_cci_2022, p16; @design_principles_data_spaces_2021].

To translate this to laymen terms, it is unlikely that Textilebase will be allowed to have a permanent, live connection to foreign national libraries, or the inventory systems of various archives and museums. But we hope that we can negotiate one-time or period, annual exchanges, supervised by both an interdisciplinary research team (...great way for research mobility....) and data stewards. Applying the dataspace design allows that such one-time or regular synchronisation opportunities are well-planned, have no significant additional costs, and can be easily overseen by legal, data security and other experts. We build Textilebase as a system that can, when permitted, receive larger data tables from various museum, library, and archive systems, or open science repositories.

Dataspaces themselves can be connected with each other. Such connections are called data federations. Textile base, by design, aims to be federated with Wikidata (the largest open knowledge graph database of the world), the Europeana Data Space (that connects various digital heritage databases in Europe), and the European Cultural Heritage Cloud, which is an extension of EOSC to various digitised heritage collections. Data federations will allow us to import any new data from the Europeana Data Space into Textilebase as soon as it appears there, and the textile curators or Texilebase will agree that the data is relevant for Textilebase itself. We can send all well-documented heritage collection items via Textilebase to Europeana and its more research-focused database.

TextileBase is technically stored in a MariaDB database extended for graph format with Wikibase. Wikibase, the software that powers Wikidata, the world's largest open graph database, has been successfully used in the past decade to create interoperable library services [@van_veen_wikidata_2019; @bianchini_beyond_2021; @sardo_wikidata_2022], museum services [@pfeiffer_representing_2021], and archives (references), and creating interoperability among the institutional silos of these three types of heritage collections [@alexiev_bulgarian_2020; @rossenova_wikidata_2022]. EU institutions themselves also use it [@semic_2020_providing_2020].

-   The author and the data stewards mentioned above oversees data curation activities. We are open to, and inviting co-creators with adequate knowledge about textile and fashion history expertise or data stewardship knowledge.

-   The researchers, currently Ieva Pigozne, is responsible for the quality assurance of the contents of the datasets.

-   Data stewards are responsible for quality assurance of data linking, data modeling, documentation, and technically correct updates.

-   Researchers and users are encouraged to report errors and contribute to improvements.

### Preservation and Archiving

-   Historical datasets are archived following the practices of Zenodo for long-term storage.

-   Data formats are chosen to ensure long-term accessibility and interoperability.

-   Metadata standards (e.g., CIDOC-CRM, DCTERMS, DataCite, and general FAIR principles) are adopted not only for interoperability but also for long-term preservation.

###Review and Continuous Improvement

-   This data publication is reviewed periodically to align with evolving best practices and technological advancements.
