# Open Music Economy Register {#sec-t12}

## Value of the Data

::: callout-note
Music registers are necessary for correctly administrating copyrights and their neighbouring rights, accounting for music on corporate and national levels, and surveying business or artistic activities. This database and its documentation show a novel way of creating a multi-purpose superregister that connects private and public registers.
:::

## Background

::: callout-note
The economic measurement of music and the administration of copyrights and neighbouring rights suffer from a lack of coordination among registers. Such problems persist on the level of national accounts and their cultural satellite accounts on a statistical level as well as on the micro-level of keeping records of authors', producers' and performers' royalties. In *Open Music Europe* we aim to provide solutions to improve data collection with novel registers.
:::

"A register aims to be a complete list of the objects in a specific group of objects or population." [@anders_register-based_2007] Norway created statistical registers to tap into governmental data stores in 1990 and into municipal ones in 1995; by 2019, it utilised about 100 records and drew data from 30 public institutional sources [@saebo_new_data_sources_2023, p1]. Like most countries, such "administrative data" was retrieved from other governmental entities, not the private sector. Collecting data from people, companies, and non-profits still relies on census-like comprehensive and sample surveys that take the form of filling out a digital or paper format or answering questions to an interviewer who fills out the form instead of the respondent.

We thrive to build a best policy practice in Slovakia within the context of the European data strategy [@european_data_strategy_2020].

Surveying is costly and often inaccurate. Asking randomly selected music creators about their received royalties over a year requires the respondent to answer questions after opening and reviewing various royalty statements or necessarily filters through the individual's cognitive biases and memory lapses. `Statistics Norway` realised that instead of asking 7000 households about what they were buying in the supermarkets, it is far more accurate and potentially cheaper to acquire the data directly from the sales logs of the supermarkets or the payment transaction records of the credit card companies. As we explained in T1.1 [@antal_slovak-cult-stat-pilot]

CEEMID, the predecessor of `Open Music Europe`, relied on similar techniques that experimenting government statisticians used: we kept asking anonymously and randomly music creators about their received royalties, but we also compared the data with the actual anonymised payouts of Artisjus in Hungary and SOZA in Slovakia.

The lessons of Norway are interesting because the new statistical law (in force since 2021) allows such data collection after a cost/benefit analysis and risk reduction carried out by `Statistics Norway`. Norway, like all EFTA countries and Eurostat participates in ESS applies the same statistical EU/EEA regulations that Slovakia, Bulgaria or Hungary applies. While in `Open Music Europe`, we are not planning and not even advocating state-mandated data collection; we find these criteria useful for voluntary data sharing with the government based on individual agreements, which we endorse in the music sector.

On the level of data coordination, we follow the recent statistical guidelines on using privately-held data to create official statistics [@unece_sbr_guidelines_2015; @un_sbr_guidelines_2020; @eurostat_sbr_manual_2021], and, in broader terms, the management and policy literature of business-to-government data sharing [@ess_position_privately_held_2017; @hleg_towards_b2g_data_2020; @vigorito_privately_held_2022; @susha_b2g_data_2022].

From a statistical point of view, our planned music industry registers can be seen as "administrative registers" because they were not initially created for a statistical purpose by a statistical authority. See more about their application for surveys in @sec-surveying.

Private institutions — such as collective management organisations, music publishers, and event promoters — often maintain far more granular and up-to-date registers than national statistical authorities. However, these internal registers are typically developed for operational purposes and are not always harmonised, standardised, or subject to the quality control procedures necessary for multi-purpose statistical use. They may be rich in detail but lack consistent classification, completeness, or interoperability.

To address this, we begin by harmonising public registers — which benefit from more robust methodological foundations — using international standards such as SDMX, ESCO, NACE, and ISCO [@sdmx_information_model_2021; @esco_ontology_2020; @isco_linked_data_2024], whenever possible, with their UK variants, too, [@uk_sic_lod_2022]. On this basis, we construct interoperable registers of authors, music performers, and music-related businesses (covering areas like recording, publishing, and live performance). These core registers are then cross-checked and enriched using data from public library systems and cultural heritage repositories, drawing on ontological patterns from DCTERMS and CIDOC CRM [@dcterms_2025; @cidoc_crm_2025].

This approach supports the harmonisation of authority files across institutional domains. It not only improves semantic alignment but also ensures traceability, transparency, and completeness in multi-use contexts — from copyright management to statistical reporting. As part of this harmonisation, we integrate both legal identifiers (e.g., national business registry numbers, OpenCorporates URIs) and creative or bibliographic identifiers such as ISNI (for creators and performers), VIAF (for authority control), ISRC (for recordings), and ISWC (for musical works). These external identifiers act as bridges, linking our internal registers to the wider ecosystem of open and authoritative data.

To complement our work with registers, we also integrate survey-based data into the same harmonised semantic framework. In our Wikibase environment, we incorporate survey questions aligned with international statistical programmes, such as the European Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) and the Eurobarometer. By reusing harmonised question formulations and structures, we ensure both comparability and interoperability with established European data infrastructures.

Crucially, we enrich these survey elements with DDI-Discovery (DDI Codebook) metadata standards, enabling structured, machine-readable descriptions of questions, variables, and datasets [@ddi_rdf_discovery_2025. While the DDI metadata model is not natively available in RDF, we extend our Wikibase data model by developing a custom representation of core DDI terminology, including representation types and base types. See [@wikibase_data_model_2025; @ddi_codebook_2020; @ddi_representation_types_2020]. This allows us to model variables and responses with the same semantic precision we apply to entities like authors, works, or enterprises.

By aligning survey metadata with our broader linked data framework, we make it possible to cross-reference survey variables with register-based indicators and other statistical data — a crucial step toward integrated, multi-source, and semantically rich cultural statistics. This approach lays the foundation for automated documentation, discovery, and comparative analysis across administrative, heritage, and survey-based data sources.

## Collection statement

::: callout-note
We are registering entities of *music works* and *sound recordings* (in statistical terms, music products), the populations are *music authors*, *music performers*, *groupings of performers* (as the majority of the musicians perform, record, release in groups, ensembles, orchestras), *record labels* (which may be formal and informal businesses) and *music publishers* (enterprises.)

The aim of our database is to support the registration and data validation, updating processes of the registers of SOZA and the Slovak Music Centre, and to establish a satellite business account for the music industry.

![](png/skcmdb/skcmdb_composers_6x4.png){fig-align="center"}

**Composers:**

-   [x] Every composer who was born on the territory of the modern Slovak Republic, worked on this territory for a significant timespan.

-   [x] Every composer who received royalties in the previous calendar year. ("Active composers")

**Publishers:**

-   [x] Every music publisher that was ever registered on the the territory of the modern Slovak Republic.

-   [x] Every music publisher who registered with SOZA and received royalties in the previous calendar year. ("Active music publishers".)

In statistical terms, we are looking for incorporated business enterprises that publish data. This activity is not described on the level of the NACE four-digit economic activity codebook and taxonomy, but on the basis of a different legal mandate, the author's collective management organisation maintains a register of active publishers.

**Producers:**

-   [x] Every record label that registered sound recordings into the `SK` top level ISRC domain.
-   [ ] Every record label that registered sound recordings into the SLOVGRAM database with recordings other than registered to the `SK` domain with a known location or seat in the Slovak Republic. This group overlaps with the KULT survey population.
-   [ ] Every record label that registered sound recordings into the SLOVGRAM database in the previous business year. ("Active music label")

**Performers:**

-   [x] Every musical group that is invited into the KULT statistical survey.
-   [ ] Every musical group associated with Slovak labels.
-   [ ] Every music performer associated with the commercially released recording of a Slovak composer's work.

**Venues:**

-   [x] Every music venue in the Slovak Music Centre database.

We must not forget that we design registers to support services. In this report, we focus on data collection services related to the economic aspects of music.

If we want to measure the average, median, maximum or minimum net copyright royalty income of composers working in Slovakia, we must align our data in two ways. We must be able to point out every composer (or at least a well-designed subsample of every composer.) In other words, this identifies the data subject. Then, we want to measure their royalty income. In that case, we have to point out each of these composers' annual royalty accounts (if we have access to such an accounting system) or send them a questionnaire to report on their income.

We must resolve two problems. First, we must be able to state who qualifies as a composer. Second, we must point out the data of these identified agents from a data source. It is good practice to identify the agents in the same way the data source will identify them.

While this document focuses on the identification problem, we must consider the requirements of the possible data sources. When our agents are natural persons, access to their data will often be restricted and anonymised, leading to further complications. When we work with enterprise data, the data sources are likely to be a company house database, a database of tax returns (we will have only anonymised access to that), or a statistical source.

## Data description

::: callout-note
Our database uses well-established data models of music agencies for human and corporate body agents, including formal and informal enterprises and groups. We must model time and location to ensure the registration of death and inheritance, succession, and dissolution. Our database is partly even-based.

The Universe and the Coverage of the survey is a group of agents (humans or corporate bodies). When we survey orchestras, the universe is all the orchestras that conform to our universe definition (musical groups that have performed at least one concert in the timespan in Slovakia.) That is in itself a subgroup of those musical groups that were inactive in the timespan.

### General model of agency

![In the Open Music Registers we aim to register agents of music who can participate in activities, events, and create economically valuable works, recordings, print music, or live performances.](png/prov/PROV-DM_for_music.png){fig-align="center"}

Agents, like persons, their groups and corporate bodies, create material entities, start processes, participate in events. Our model has a high-level interoperability because it models agency similar to rather foundational ontologies that are re-used in \[the field of music\] in the GLAM sector .

One unusual element of a register that administers copyrights is that it contains data on deceased people and their heirs because the economic rights embedded in copyrights have a protection term beyond the author's death, and they are inherited. Consequently, a copyright register contains people who are neither composers, producers or performers of music but heirs without any music-related occupation. Some royalty payments leave the universe of living artists and go to heirs.

In event-based conceptual models, some of the properties of humans would be modelled differently. We use a simplified model that leaves out technical events in the database. For example, the **Birth of Ludwig van Beethoven** is an event, which had participants (mother, son), and an unknown place and time. While we do not know the time, we know that it must have taken place before the baptism of Beethoven (which is recorded with place and time.)

For rich inferences, we would export our database into a graph that assigns dates to events. For our purposes, we directly link W.A. Mozart or L.udwig van Beethoven to dates of birth, baptism, or death, but if we want to expand our knowledge about their vital circumstances, we may need to create events.

![The agent data is described in several languages. It can be searched, validated, extended with the citizen-scientist level Wikibase graphical user interface, or with the MediaWiki API and SPARQL queries.](png/names/reprexbase_tutorial_add_new_language_03_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

The general rules that we follow:

-   Human Agent -\> Birth (Activity) - \> Timespan (date with day precision) + Location + Parents (if needed) is simplified to Human agent -\> `date of birth`, `place of birth`.

-   Corporate Body Agent -\> Inception (Activity) -\> Timespan (date with day, month, or year precision) + Location + Founders present, is simplified to corporate body `founder`, `inception date`.

-   Human Agent -\> Death (Event) -\> Timespan + Location + Heirs (with respect to copyrights) is currently simplified to `date of death`.

-   Corporate Agent -\> Succession (Event) or Dissolution (Event) -\> Timespan is simplified to `successor` and `date of dissolution`.

A very important aspect of human agents is their role or occupation in music. A role is a professional participation in music processes and activities, which, if habitual, becomes an occupation.

The *International Standard Classification of Occupations* (ISCO) is a four-level classification of occupation groups managed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Its structure follows a grouping by education level. The two latest versions of ISCO are ISCO-88 (dating from 1988) and ISCO-08 (dating from 2008). ISCO is implemented in a largely harmonised way all over the world with relatively small differences. The ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) is the EU's definition [@esco_handbook] , while the SSC (Standard Skill Classification) which is adapted specifically for the UK job market. [@ssc_2023].

### Informal corporate bodies: orchestras, informal enterprises

The modern definitions used by the OECD, ILO, or IMF recognise the importance of the informal economy, and do not see it as an anomaly, but see the informal economy as a core component of economies at every level of development:

> “the informal economy refers to all economic activities, excluding illicit activities, by workers and economic units that are, in law or in practice, not covered or insufficiently covered by formal arrangements \[…\] While the informal economy exists everywhere, it is more prevalent in low-income countries, where it represents 89 per cent of total employment, compared to 82 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively, in lower-middle and upper-middle-income countries and 16 per cent in high-income countries.” [@ilo_recommendation_R204_2015]

From a methodological point of view, we surveyed the problems and solutions of the high level of the music sector in [@antal_et_al_music_economy_2023] as a methodological preparation of this work.

Our earlier research shows that in the 12 European countries, including Slovakia, a very high percentage of commercially released sound recordings are registered outside of the national domain of the ISRC registry.

In Slovakia, the majority of the cases fall outside the `SK` domain; registration outside of the country is widespread in Hungary and Poland, too, and it even occurs in the United Kingdom with independent labels that use foreign distributors. This is very logical: small member states like Malta, Estonia, or Latvia with a small population and music sector have very few entities capable of registration and commercialisation and artist working in such smaller countries tend to work with commercial agents from larger countries. (In the case of the United Kingdom, this larger country is the United States of America.) It is nearly impossible to say who has released a sound recording within a year and acted in the capacity of a music label in a country.

The best way to come to an almost comprehensive register is via the neighbouring rights societies, which have similar transparency requirements as author's societies, and they need to make public how they give them the mandate to collect neighbouring rights royalties from the broadcasting, transmission and various public performance locations. A music label with a serious business presence in a country such as Slovakia is expected to make an effort to collect such revenues, which, especially in emerging markets, maybe more than 50% of their total revenue (after adding private copying compensation.)

The high level of informality in both the live and the recorded sector means that many agents act as sole proprietors. In such cases, they may even use the same name they use in private life. The challenge is to protect their right to privacy as private persons and, at the same time, maintain transparency for their economic activities. A sole proprietor who releases music as a self-releasing or self-publishing author with a foreign distributor or publisher within the European Union is not only registered in the country's enterprise and tax register but also in the VIES standard VAT register of the European Union and Northern Ireland.

In such cases, we can cross-check with such state/EU registers, and identification is possible, but GDPR must be addressed, and the various interests of music business transparency, freedom of research and right to privacy must be balanced. Our register can identify these agents, but it must be addressed which part of this register can be made public and what uses are allowed. This question should be dealt with as the legal interoperability of our register.

Groups are connected to humans. For example, to register an orchestra into VIAF, the register of national libraries, we must give an inception date and the founding members.

::: callout-note
*The Beatles* evolved in 1960 from John Lennon's previous group, the *Quarrymen* (predecessor), and built their reputation by playing in clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, starting in 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962.

*The Beatles* has an inception in 1960 with four members: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Best. In 1962, before their first commercial release, Best is replaced by Starr. All studio recording releases define The Beatles as a group of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr, however, after the dissolution of the band in 1969-1970, several recordings were released to the public that were recorded originally before 1962. Therefore, there are some known Beatles recordings where Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Best form the group.
:::

Orchestras and bands that do not perform only in an amateur, educational or liturgical function must be able to receive payments for their performances. It is necessary that the musical group as a corporate body is linked to an entity that can issue invoice and account for the revenues and their taxes.

![Musical groups (orchestras, choirs, bands, duos) are best modelled as informal corporate bodies, because their informal and formal structures often do not overlap. Example from a subclass of the Slovak musical groups, symphony orchestras at <https://reprexbase.eu/demo/index.php?title=Item:Q1165>\>](png/skcmdb/skcmdb_orchestras_symphony_6x4.png){fig-align="center"}

In statistical terms, we are looking for various agents that produce sound recordings to make them available to the public. On mass broadcasting, retransmission and streaming platforms, a sound recording can only be made available if it is commercially released and has an ISRC identifier.

Such agents are sole proprietors, formal and informal enterprises (labels), often working within a larger corporate entity, and sometimes, they are incorporated enterprises with a relatively homogeneous economic activity profile.

### Musicians works and recordings

The purpose of our surveying register is to help to collect data on the agents of music. We develop our register in a way that human agents in composer, producer and performing roles can be connected to their works, recorded, print and live public performance manifestations. We will show our work and manifestation register in a separate document.

::: callout-note
#### Is A Work in the Public Domain?

A possible application of SKCMDb is to find out if a work needs a license or it is in the public domain.

The query needed for this is connecting a Musical Work (Symphony No. 9.) to all known composers (Ludwig van Beethoven) and to all `date of death` properties. If all of them are earlier than the calendar year number for the previous year minus 70, i.e., 2024-70, we conclude that the work is in the public domain.

For the purpose of the economy register, a work register is not necessary, but for most uses of the SKCMDb, this connection is needed.
:::

### Formal corporate bodies: municipalities, enterprises, foundations

Concert promoters are usually easier to observe than orchestras, but their form varies. They can be enterprises with an economic activity (classified with a `NACE` code), NGOs, or public bodies, such as municipalities. Concert promoters are found in several state registers, and crucially, they should be found in the licensing database of author's societies. Only those concert promoters who put on stage out-of-copyright or exclusively liturgical music (in churches, synagogues, etc.) are exempted.

![A formal corporation from the music publishers' register. \<<https://reprexbase.eu/demo/index.php?title=Item:Q201>\>](png/skcmdb/skcmdb_music_publishers_atempo_6x4.png){fig-align="center"}

The concert producers (as orchestras) should be somewhere in the register of enterprises or sole proprietors, but finding them is looking for a needle in the hay. They may use a company of one of the members for this purpose, which has an entirely independent main economic activity from R90 performing arts. We will show the difficulties of capturing live music events with the hypothetical example of Amber Smith, a band, playing in a free show of organised by Nagymaros, a municipality. The members of Amber Smith do get paid.

::: callout-note
#### Concert economics: supply side

There is a band called Amber Smith (band). It is a corporate body (Group) in CIDOC-CRM, an agent in DCTERMS.

The band has a corporate body, Ambersmith Kft. that is a legal entity. It is owned by the members of Ambersmith (band).

The Ambersmith Kft. has main economic activity of Performing Arts.
:::

```{r concertsupply,eval=FALSE}

    skos:notation "R900" ;  # The NACE code
    skos:prefLabel "Performing Arts"@en . # Label (optional)
```

If we want to measure concert economics, we need to be able to see the payment transaction connected to the payer or the payee.

Who may have a record with both agents (payer and payee?). The author's rights organisations must license this public music performance so they have information about both the payee and the payer.

::: callout-note
#### Concert economics: demand side

There is a corporate body, the municipality of `Nagymaros`.

`Nagymaros` organises an Event called "Free Concert".

`Nagymaros` pays for the performance of `Ambersmith (band)` to `Ambersmith Kft.`

A potential complication is that actually a non-profit company owned by the municipality, `Nagymaros Cultural Events Non-Profit Kft` pays the `Ambersmith Kft.`.
:::

```{r concertdemand, eval=FALSE}
# Municipality of Nagymaros
<http://example.org/nagymaros-municipality> a crm:E74_Group ; # Corporate body
    schema:name "Municipality of Nagymaros" . # Optional name

```

The connection between the live music production (Amber Smith and Ambersmith Kft) and the staging of the music (Nagymaros municipality and its non-profit cultural entity) are connected in space and time if Artisjus, the Hungarian collective rights management agency, licenses. In this case, the licensing database contains both important Agents, the time, space, and likely some other variables like maximum capacity of the location, if the event is ticketed or not, if ticketed, and what the ticket price is.

Concerts are very often organised by entities that are not for-profit businesses and do not have a `NACE` code. Non-profits use the *International Classification of Non-Profit Organizations (ICNPO)*, and the European Union uses various classification for pubic sector entities such as the municipality of the town of Nagymaros.

The Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, commonly referred to as `NACE` (for the French term "nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne"). It is derived from the UN classification [ISIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Industrial_Classification), revision 4.

The Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, commonly referred to as `NACE` (for the French term "*nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne*"), is the industry standard classification system used in the European Union. The United Kingdom has a slightly different version of NACE called

At the time of Brexit, the EU (and the UK) used the second revision of NACE [@nace_rev2], currently, the EU prepares for the rollout of the the revision 2.1 in 2025 [@nace_2.1], while the UK uses the United Kingdom Standard Industrial Classification of economic activities (UK SIC) [@uk_sic].

Just like with the occupation taxonomies, the economic activity taxonomies are hierarchical, so the EU, the UK and other regions will be aligned by `ISIC` to a certain point. The EU itself is aiming alignment at the level of four-digit precision; and member states (and the UK) often create five- or six-digit precision versions.

One problem with applying NACE is that it is designed for larger corporations and does not work very well with microenterprises that show some level of informality (and does not apply to informal enterprises.) Microenterprises often have an unclear economic activity profile, and their data is also lacking in detail. A larger company that applies the IFRS financial reporting standards (or its UK or any European national form) must report specific segments of its business separately. However, a company smaller than the "small" enterprise threshold falls under a simplified accounting (and tax reporting) scheme in perhaps every European country. Some countries must only report a net turnover and profit after tax. In the United Kingdom, four scenarios may apply to microenterprises, and in one case, it must not even report any flow variables (like net turnover or profit after tax.) [@icaew_appendix]

The use of NACE is particularly problematic for music because it does not provide a clear mapping for music corporate bodies that fall under the enterprise definition. (The same problem applies to some music occupations), and even if it does, it will identify some data poor subjects. A bigger problem is that many music corporate bodies do not have a NACE code, for example, because they work as an "informal enterprise" or as a non-profit entity or a public body. NACE appears to be somewhat suitable to identify music publisher, but hardly suitable for music labels, and perhaps entire unsuitable for concert promoters and concert venues.

### Business-to-business users of music

NACE is not absolutely useless, of course. Identifying some licensed user groups of music, such as radios, is rather good. Sole proprieators cannot operate radios in most member states, and the market share of community radios operated by small non-profits (who do not have a NACE code) is relatively low. The bulk of radio stations that pay a licensing fee for broadcasting music usually have a NACE code that is well mapped to their activities. The same can be said about television broadcasters and cable retransmission entities.

Often, the research question in business or academia is not related to music creation, but the values the creations in their business use. This leads to registering a different set of agents, i.e., agents who use music in business-to-business relations. In cultural access and participation surveys, we also may ask natural persons as music users.

Corporate user agents have a simple typology in the use of the mechanical licensing mode; these are producers of physical records or labels who benefit from the collective management of authors' rights for mechanical copying.

A massive group of music enterprises are the agents that use music in public performance and retransmission.

-   [x] `Public performance of live music events` (foreground music): festival organisers and permanent venues that stage music; either with a main focus on music staging (concert halls, music clubs) or multi-purpose cultural or entertainment venues such as arenas and cultural establishments. Such agents are usually part of the formal economy, but they are often not corporations but municipalities, associations, foundations, and religious associations. Informality is an issue.
-   [x] `Broadcasting and retransmission` of recorded music via radio, television, cable and satellite television, in which cases we deal with a relatively low number of well-established users who may have their registered, for example, because national authorities register and distribute access to the broadcasting wave spectrum. Informality should not be an issue; private persons very rarely operate private radios or TVs.
-   [x] `Public performance` (background music) of recording music, such as restaurants, hotels, retail outlets, various public buildings like malls, health facilities, workplaces like warehouses. Informality is an issue in the restaurant subsector.

## Experimental design, materials and methods {#sec-experimental}

::: callout-note
Our connected registers are, to our knowledge, unique; they utilise recently novel statistical production and legal regulatory innovations to connect public and private registers. Our database's data governance and exchange are unique because of the serious data protection restrictions posed by the use of both public statistical and private registers.
:::

A *statistical register* is a continuously or regularly updated set of objects for a given population. It contains information on the identification and accessibility of population units as well as other attributes which support the surveying process of the population. It serves as a constantly updated list of potential data sources: people or enterprises, for example, who may be invited to a sample survey or a census. The statistical register is both a coordination tool for data collection (everybody is found who should provide data), and an important data quality management tool (we know if somebody was not found, how it will distort our resulting datasets.) For example, as earlier stated, `Statistics Norway` applies about 100 statistical registers.

Our primary concern in Slovakia is the creation of a music business register, because this could provide indicators for the public policy-level and institutional/enterprise level implementation of the Slovak cultural strategy.

The authoritative source on statistical business registers is the *United Nations Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers. Final draft prior to official editing* [@un_sbr_guidelines_2020] which is heavily based on the former UNECE *Guidelines on statistical business registers* [@unece_sbr_guidelines_2015]. The European guideline is the *European business statistics methodological manual for statistical business registers. 2021 edition* [@eurostat_sbr_manual_2021].

Our register is designed to work with relational databases that are regularly used in rights management or GLAM organisations to manage membership lists and catalogues and, at the same time, work with graph databases that are increasingly replacing relational databases for supporting trustworthy, human-controlled AI.

As a conceptual model, we use the Wikibase Data model, which is described on the ontological level. For the sake of interoperability, we created classes and relationship types that follow strict equivalence with the GLAM standard ontologies and, whenever possible, with Polifonia Music Match and the Music Ontology.

For music economic research, further extensions are needed to the GSIM statistical information model (for surveying and processing answers, see @sec-surveying) and the ISIC-ESCO and ISIC-NACE-SIC classification systems.

### Occupations

The European Union recently published its ESCO taxonomy in an ontological form, [@papantoniou_esco_2023], which is already connected to two registers (the *Awarding Body* register for those European institutions that can award a qualification and *Work Context Awarding Bodies*.) Awarding bodies are not very important in music, because most musicians acquire skills by informal learning practices [@green_music_2017].

The ISCO/ESCO systems have the following pillars:

-   Occupation (these relate to habitual roles)

-   Skill (and competences)

-   Qualification

We utilise the ESCO ontological form, because it can support any ISCO-originated taxonomy with a clear interoperability with registers. The ISCO (and its ESCO and SOC) implementations as taxonomies are hierarchical: on the top level, every UN member state applies them the same. Beyond a certain level of granularity, the EU and UK can diverge, or new applications can be built. We actually aim to build a divergent taxonomy that adds further granularity to the point where the EU and UK definitions are still aligned.

When we want to understand the relative economic, environmental or social weight of music activities and processes, we must be able to use a systematic taxonomy of such occupations and roles. The current international occupation taxonomy, ISCO and its European ESCO extension are not sufficiently detailed for understanding music.

In the creation of new musical work, we are talking about natural persons who have an occupation as a *composer*. In ESCO 2652.1 describes the *composer*, and 2652.1.1 describes the *music arranger*, and 2641.4.1 the *lyricist*. (Most composer do not make a living out of composing only, and this is not their only occupation; so one human agent usually has several parallel roles or occupations.)

> Lyricists interpret the style of a music piece and write words to accompany the melody. They work together with the music composer.

A note: in the current ESCO definition the composer *excludes sound artist, lyricist and music arranger.*; the exclusion of the lyricists is ambiguous. Lyrics can be registers as a literary work and as part of a musical work. It needs further validation if this ESCO taxonomical difference causes problems in our data model.

In ESCO, `2654.3.1` *incorrectly* describes a music producer as

> Music producers are responsible for acquiring music to be published. They listen to demos of songs and determine whether they are good enough to be published. Music producers oversee the production of records. They manage the technical aspects of recording and editing.

In fact, music producers deal with the release of recordings, and not with the publishing of musical works.

As human agents, in the ESCO definition: "musicians perform a vocal or musical part that can be recorded or played for an audience. They have know-how and practice of one or many instruments or using their voice. The musician can also write and transcribe music."

So, if we want to measure consistently the economic activities of music professionals (as natural persons agents), we should come up with a description of habitual occupations or roles within these occupations that are understood the same way in the United Kingdom or Slovakia. This is beyond the scope of this document, but in the background of Open Music Europe there is plenty of experience for doing this for the purpose of harmonised surveying of music professionals.

Our approach to understanding a music professionals occupation is a two-stage filtering, which starts with the Eurobarometer standardised, non-country-specific general occupation question.

As a second step we establish artistic roles which can be seen as extensions of the ISCO/ESCO `235` class. More formal mapping and extension could be carried out, but given that labour force statistics are usually not available with more granularity, the current level of mapping is sufficient for comparison with official statistics.

As an example, we show the CEEMID survey codebook in English and Lithuanian. The codebook is also available in Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, German, English, Hungarian, Polish (needs editing), Romanian, Serbian, and Slovak.

The following grouping works are harmonised ISCO, European ESCO, North American or UK occupation taxonomies, too. This means that a survey that is conducted among music professionals should result compatible results with labour force statistics in the same country at least on the granularity ISCO/ESCO 2 or 3 digit levels.

### Economic activities of corporations

Another important classification is `ISIC` (UN) or `NACE` (EU) or `SIC` (UK). This is a taxonomy for the economic activities of enterprises. Some member states, like the Netherlands or Hungary, apply a national extension of NACE to sole proprietors, which overlaps with the ISCO/ESCO/SOC defined occupational activities, but only in the case of sole proprietors. For example, in the relevant taxonomy for Hungarian sole proprietors, those sole proprietors of music whose main economic activity is have a code of `900102`, derived from NACE `9000`. `ISIC`, `NACE`, or SIC is only suitable for the classification of some enterprises.

## Data Curation Policy for SKCMDb

**1. Introduction** The creators of SKCMDb are committed to maintaining high-quality, accurate, and reliable data for research and analysis. This policy outlines the principles and processes governing the curation, management, and dissemination of data within the database.

**2. Data Scope and Coverage** The database curates and maintains data relevant to the economic activities of musicians, composers, their corporate bodies, and music businesses in the territory of the Slovak Republic. We include agents who work music performers or composers who were born in the Slovak Republic, use Slovak language lyrics, or identify with the Slovak ethnicity, or one of the minority ethnic groups of the Slovak Republic, even if they work abroad.

The dataset contains the properties (in columns) of observations of music agents (in rows). Categorical information, such as type of use of the agent, are used by a classification system, which is currently based on the classification system of the Slovak Music Centre with slight modification. The classification system is developed by Anna Žilková, Anna Márta Mester and Dániel Antal.

`SKCMDb`, which contains these dataset, is technically stored in a MariaDB database extended for graph format with Wikibase. Wikibase, the software that powers Wikidata, the world's largest open graph database, has been successfully used in the past decade to create interoperable library services [@van_veen_wikidata_2019; @bianchini_beyond_2021; @sardo_wikidata_2022], museum services [@pfeiffer_representing_2021], and archives (references), and creating interoperability among the institutional silos of these three types of heritage collections [@alexiev_bulgarian_2020; @rossenova_wikidata_2022]. EU institutions themselves also use it [@semic_2020_providing_2020].

### Data Collection and Ingestion

#### Primary data sources

The population register is the primary data source for labour surveys and other personal surveys in the Slovak Republic. Researchers cannot access this register directly.

For **Human** agents, we use

-   [ ] the database of SOZA, which contains all living and deceased persons known to hold copyrights in Slovakia in relational database tables;
-   [x] the database of the Slovak Music Centre, which contains information about living and deceased human persons as composers and performers (including music directors or conductors) and educators in relational database tables;
-   [x] Wikipedia contains data about notable human agents in a loosely structured form of narrative encyclopaedic entries,
-   [x] Wikidata contains data about notable human agents in graph format.
-   [ ] The database(s) of sole proprietors who are registered to conduct regular business activities and may be registered for European community VAT transactions. We are still investigating the legal implications of using this data source.

For **Corporate bodies**:

-   [x] The registered music publishers are in the SOZA database.
-   [x] The database of the Slovak Music Centre, which contains information on certain musical groups
-   [x] The registration data of IFPI Czechia and Slovakia.
-   [x] The company house register of the Slovak Republic.
-   [x] The statistical register of the KULT surveys in the Slovak Republic for orchestras, record labels, and concert venue operators.
-   [x] Open Corporates is a global register of legal entities that contains all Slovak music businesses, and almost all European music businesses.

![The register of music publishers in Slovakia](png/skcmdb/skcmdb_music_publishers_6x4.png){fig-align="center"}

For **Events**, we are are only experimenting with the connection of the following data sources:

-   [x] The concert calendar of the Slovak Music Centre. Historical data on events from the Slovak Music Centre.
-   [ ] The non-public licensing database of SOZA that contains information about licensed music events.

For **Places**, we are only experimenting with the connection of concert venues with actual events, and participating music performers and concert promoters.

-   [x] The concert calendar of the Slovak Music Centre for locations. Historical location data on events from the Slovak Music Centre.
-   [ ] The non-public licensing database of SOZA that contains information about the location of public performance venues.

### Limitations

::: callout-note
Our register contains data about living and deceased natural persons and informal and formal corporate bodies. The legal requirements to use the data vary; the use of human data subjects is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union, among other regulations.
:::

The SOZA membership register is not directly accessible. However, it is accessible to send out a survey to the people registered on this list no more than once a year. The statistical properties of the registered humans (such as the number of registered living persons, mean or average age, and distribution of certain income) are available for testing survey coverage. For example, it is possible to test how closely anonymous responses in a survey correlate with the actual target population (universe), i.e., to test the representative coverage within the anonymised survey responses.

### Data Quality and Integrity

-   Data undergoes regular validation and integrity checks to ensure accuracy. This includes human validation by Anna Žilková as the head of the Department of Documentation and Informatics at the Slovak Music Centre, and integrity checks by the data stewards.

-   Version control is implemented to track changes and updates; each published new version received a version-DOI on Zenodo.

-   Erroneous or obsolete data is flagged, corrected, or archived appropriately.

### Data Ontologies, Taxonomies, and Enrichment

Importantly, ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) and SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) are available in fully ontological forms [@esco_ontology_2020; @sdmx_information_model_2021]. This means they are encoded in a formal, machine-readable structure that includes logic-based reasoning rules — allowing computers to automatically infer relationships and classifications. These ontologies support dynamic alignment, semantic validation, and intelligent linking across datasets.

In contrast, NACE (the EU’s economic activity classification), the UK's SIC [@uk_sic_lod_2022] and ISCO (the International Standard Classification of Occupations) are available as linked open taxonomies [@nace_linked_data_2024; @isco_linked_data_2024]. While also machine-readable and publicly accessible, they lack the deeper logical structure of ontologies. They are essentially structured vocabularies — excellent for standardising terms and enabling cross-referencing, but without the capacity for automated reasoning or rich semantic querying.

Together, these resources enable the Open Music Observatory to embed music industry and cultural data in a broader ecosystem of interoperable, standards-aligned, and future-proof knowledge infrastructures — bridging national data with European and global statistical frameworks.

We use elements and patterns from five formal, general-purpose ontologies expressed in the standard ontology languages OWL, RDF (with extension of RDFS), and we also aim for interoperability with application of the Music Ontology and the Polifonia Music Meta.

Our business users, including music artists and their corporate bodies and enterprise will most likely need interoperability with Schema.org, which standardises most commercial web applications. Our memory institution partners will likely want interoperability with Dublin Core, *Records in Context*, or *CIDOC*; we believe that this is also rather suitable for most rights management tasks.

Our research users want to be compatible with GSIM, SDMX, and DDI, to create questionnaires, administer surveys that get responses to the questions, model the question representations to receive output variables and process them statistically to be used in various academic, business, or policy research.

The interoperability with such statistical applications is tangential but important: it is important that target population is well-described and the responses are well-connected to important attributes of the data subjects, such as their music occupations or economic activities in music.

Metadata schemas and controlled vocabularies are used to enhance data organization and discoverability.

-   Our primary interoperability target is museum applications, so we use the CIDOC-CRM ontology [@cidoc_2024], abbreviated in this document with the `crm` prefix.

-   Our secondary interoperability target is with library applications for cross-referencing research and data that cites the objects in the collections. We use the Dublin Core library ontology, DCTERMS for this purpose [@dublin_core_dcmi_2020], abbreviated with the `dcterms` prefix in this document. DCTERMS provides a wide interoperability with data repositories, as they often use DCTERMS as their foundation ontology.

-   Our third interoperability target is DataCite, which is the preferred ontology for European open science repositories. [@datacite_metadata_scheme_4-4]

-   Records in Contexts is the new archive standard [@RiC-CM_1_0].

For ensuring that researchers and their software applications understand our descriptions the same way the descriptions of garments and their provenance information, we use the following controlled vocabularies.

-   For describing places (of original provenance and current hold locations), we use Geonames, a global taxonomy of place names.

### Data Updates and Maintenance

-   The database is updated on a regular basis, with at least one update in every quarter (three months.) We may update more frequently if we acquire significant new data.

-   Changes in data sources or methodologies are documented transparently.

-   Regular audits are conducted to identify and resolve inconsistencies.

For manual updates, see our [Working with Persons in Wikibase](https://opencollections.net/documents/tutorials/wikibase_persons_tutorial.html#/title-slide) tutorial.

### Data Access and Sharing

![Temporary opening page here. We will change this to the final (not demo) page by the end of February.](png/skcmdb/skcmdb_opening_page_2x1.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

We define several levels of data access. For reading the data:

-   [x] Reading public datasets manually does not require password authentication. The data will be available with a Creative Commons license [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). We will provide a commercial policy, too, in the next update of the Dissemination, Exploitation and Communication deliverable.

-   [x] API access to mass-download data requires a "bot" username and password with a CSFR-authenticated session. This is technically possible, and we have rather detailed technical documentation, but we have not yet opened a request for these API users.

-   [x] SPARQL queries: no password is needed for public datasets (this function does not work yet; we plan this functionality to work by the end of March.)

-   [x] Read access to restricted data: requires an explicit agreement from data owners.

For writing the data:

-   [x] Suggesting manual corrections and extensions requires a username and a password to provide data provenance to data changes. Experimentally, we have provided manual user names and passwords and are working on the data stewardship model to review changes.

-   [x] Mass upload data via API: technically possible with a bot user, password, and CSFR token. Currently, only Reprex has mass upload rights.

### Data Security and Privacy

-   We do not handle personal data, with the exception of adding names of data curators, researchers, who must be attributed as creators of the dataset.

-   Access to our datasets is not strictly controlled, however, only the dataset placed in the Zenodo scientific repository is authentic for re-use. We use Zenodo to create an independent, trusted, authoritative copy of the dataset with versions, identified by a new DOI for each new version.

### Governance and Responsibilities

We follow the dataspace concept in building SKCMDb. A dataspace is an emerging approach to data management which recognises that in large-scale integration scenarios involving many partners, it would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to obtain an upfront unifying schema across all sources or to come to a legal agreement on the terms of using or exchanging the data. It is an intelligent application that allows a near-instantaneous exchange, processing, sharing and provision of data on an “as-needed” or “as-permitted” basis while retaining complete control of each data holder over the conditions (e.g., who, when, and under what condition) of access to their data [@curry_dataspaces_2020; @dataspace_for_cci_2022, p16; @design_principles_data_spaces_2021].

To translate this to laymen terms, it is unlikely that SKCMDb will be allowed to have a permanent, live connection to national libraries, or the inventory systems of various archives and museums. But we hope that we can negotiate one-time or period, annual exchanges, supervised by both an interdisciplinary research team and data stewards. Applying the dataspace design allows that such one-time or regular synchronisation opportunities are well-planned, have no significant additional costs, and can be easily overseen by legal, data security and other experts. We build SKCMDb as a system that can, when permitted, receive larger data tables from various museum, library, and archive systems, or open science repositories.

Dataspaces themselves can be connected with each other. Such connections are called data federations. SKCMDb , by design, aims to be federated with Wikidata (the largest open knowledge graph database of the world), the Europeana Data Space (that connects various digital heritage databases in Europe), and the [European Cultural Heritage Cloud](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research-area/social-sciences-and-humanities/cultural-heritage-and-cultural-and-creative-industries-ccis/cultural-heritage-cloud_en), which will be an extension of the [European Open Science Cloud](https://eosc.eu/eosc-about/) (EOSC) to various digitised heritage collections [@eccch_ex_ante_2022]. Data federations will allow us to import any new data from the Europeana Data Space into SKCMDb as soon as it appears there, and the music experts or SKCMDb will agree that the data is relevant for SKCMDb itself. We can send all well-documented heritage collection items via SKCMDb to Europeana and its more research-focused database.

SKCMDb is technically stored in a MariaDB database extended for graph format with Wikibase. Wikibase, the software that powers Wikidata, the world's largest open graph database, has been successfully used in the past decade to create interoperable library services [@van_veen_wikidata_2019; @bianchini_beyond_2021; @sardo_wikidata_2022], museum services [@pfeiffer_representing_2021], and archives (references), and creating interoperability among the institutional silos of these three types of heritage collections [@alexiev_bulgarian_2020; @rossenova_wikidata_2022]. EU institutions themselves also use it [@semic_2020_providing_2020].

-   The author and the data stewards mentioned above oversees data curation activities. We are open to, and inviting co-creators with adequate knowledge about textile and fashion history expertise or data stewardship knowledge.

-   Data stewards are responsible for quality assurance of data linking, data modeling, documentation, and technically correct updates.

-   Researchers and users are encouraged to report errors and contribute to improvements.

### Preservation and Archiving

-   Historical datasets are archived following the practices of Zenodo for long-term storage.

-   Data formats are chosen to ensure long-term accessibility and interoperability.

-   Metadata standards (e.g., CIDOC-CRM, DCTERMS, DataCite, and general FAIR principles) are adopted not only for interoperability but also for long-term preservation.

### Review and Continuous Improvement

-   This data publication is reviewed periodically to align with evolving best practices and technological advancements.
