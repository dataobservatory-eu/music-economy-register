# Surveying {#sec-surveying}

Using our register to support surveys requires integration with two important frameworks: the *Generic Statistical Information Model* (GSIM) and the *Data Documentation Initiative* (DDI). This section focuses on identifying the *universe* (the full target population) and the *coverage* (the portion of the population actually surveyed). These elements must be clearly linked to survey responses, which are then transformed into measurable variables.

Our goal is to build a harmonised approach that supports both ex-ante and ex-post survey design. A more complete technical discussion will be presented in a separate report. Here, we concentrate on ensuring that survey designs start from a well-defined universe and achieve measurable coverage.

The **Statistical Business Register (SBR)** is a foundational tool for statistical production [@eurostat_methodological_sbr_2021]. It provides the basis for constructing survey frames—deciding who is included in a data collection effort. SBRs are used to identify target populations for both sample-based and census-style surveys. Our music economy register operates in parallel to these structures, adapted to cultural sector specifics, and remains interoperable with national and European statistical systems.

Depending on the survey method, the register can support three main approaches:

- **Sample surveys**: The register serves as the sampling frame from which a representative subset of the population is randomly selected for questionnaire or interview requests.
- **Census-style surveys**: Every unit listed in the register—such as all active music publishers or labels—is contacted to supply data. The goal is full population coverage.
- **Register-based surveys**: Data is not collected through questionnaires but retrieved directly from systems of data holders (e.g., collective management organisations or tax authorities). The register ensures the completeness and traceability of linked data sources.

## Extending with GSIM

To make the register usable for survey-based statistical production, it must be extended in line with the Generic Statistical Information Model (GSIM). In particular, we need to connect the identification of agents and activities to each phase of the survey lifecycle, from question design to data analysis.

In an *ex-ante* context, this means linking survey questions to structured representations: concepts, variables, classifications, and permissible value domains. This ensures that each question is grounded in the register’s metadata and semantic model.

In an *ex-post* context, responses must be linked back to these same representations, so that results can be analysed in relation to registered attributes, such as legal status, sector classification, or professional role.

This alignment allows us to treat surveys and registers as components of a shared, interoperable statistical infrastructure. It enhances transparency and reusability by ensuring that both inputs (questions) and outputs (variables) are traceable to their conceptual basis and population frame.

GSIM, SDMX, and DDI are complementary standards that support this interoperability across statistical and research systems:

- *GSIM* provides the conceptual framework for describing information objects used in the production of official statistics, including surveys, registers, and outputs [@GSIM_v20_2025].
- *SDMX* defines data structures and exchange formats for sharing statistical data and metadata between organisations [@sdmx_information_model_v3].
- *DDI* offers metadata structures for documenting survey processes—covering concepts, questions, response formats, coding schemes, and derived variables [@ddi_codebook_2020].

Together, these standards enable us to harmonise metadata across systems and ensure semantic consistency from data collection through to analysis.

### Identifying the subjects

The *Agent* classes in our model correspond to the data subjects within the target population. In administrative or enterprise surveys, we can directly link responses to agents via unique identifiers—such as a company registration number.

In population-based surveys, responses are often anonymous. In these cases, we rely on well-structured categorical variables to interpret and generalise results. These categories help profile respondents (e.g., gender, role, occupation) and ensure that response quotas are met—for example, to avoid surveys completed only by men or only by composers.

Assigning respondents to groups such as *Composers* or *Performers* relies on these pre-defined categorical variables. This structure corresponds directly to the roles and occupations recorded in the register.

Such groupings allow us to calculate indicators like the average income or number of works composed separately for performers, composers, and producers.

#### Occupational and economic outcomes

Often, we aim to measure the outcomes of creative and economic activities as numerical variables—for example, the number of works composed during the reference period, or the royalties received.

Temporal logic is important: royalties reported in, say, 2025 typically relate to works composed or registered earlier.

To ensure reliable measurement, numerical variables must be paired with well-defined units of measure (such as euros or forints) and logically coded missing value types:

- *Filtered*: the respondent was not asked the question.
- *Declined*: the respondent refused to answer.
- *Unknown*: the respondent did not know the answer.

These codes must be designed *ex-ante* and consistently applied in the data model.

#### Ex-post processing

When variables and categories are well-defined *ex-ante*, *ex-post* processing becomes straightforward.

Numerical variables can be aggregated using standard statistical measures (e.g., mean, median, weighted mean), while missing value categories are preserved and counted separately.

Groupings such as respondent country can support stratified analysis. For example, we can calculate separate income estimates for Slovakia and Hungary, and place them into an SDMX-compliant data cube, where each dimension (role, geography, year) can be subsetted or sliced for detailed analysis.


## Surveying the music economy

As described in Appendix A, our register is built around *agents*—human or corporate—whose activities are recorded for economic, cultural, or statistical purposes. For survey purposes, we extend this model with two key concepts from the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI): the *universe* (the target population) and *coverage* (the actual surveyed population).

### Open Music Europe WP1: Music Economy

In Task 1.2 and related activities, we aimed to collect more complete data about the Slovak, Hungarian, and Polish music economies. In this context, we are interested in surveying economic activity—what music business actors do, earn, and contribute.

We define *music business actors* as individuals, groups, or legal entities engaged in economically meaningful activities: earning royalties, employing others, or generating gross value added. This gross value added contributes to regional or national GDP.

These actors organise performances, sell tickets, release recordings, and license music for various uses such as recordings, film, or theatre. Their activities are classified according to:

- NACE/ISIC codes for corporate bodies (in the United States and United Kingdom: SIC), and
- ISCO/ESCO codes for individual occupations (in the United Kingdom: SOC).

Sole proprietors are a key category in music. They often have national-level five-digit NACE codes (beyond the harmonised four-digit level), reflecting their specific business activities, although these are not harmonised EU-wide. They may also be assigned ISCO/ESCO occupation codes—even if they are unaware of these classifications themselves.

### Performing arts agents

On the performance side, the primary agents are:

- Individuals in roles such as musician, instrumentalist, or vocalist
- Corporate bodies such as music groups (bands, orchestras, ensembles, duos, trios, choirs)

These groups take diverse organisational forms. Some orchestras are formally incorporated as partnerships or limited liability companies. Others are embedded within public institutions, such as broadcasters or theatres. Many popular music groups function informally, without a registered legal entity.

While linking performing groups to business entities is possible, our register focuses on capturing the *corporate body* identity of the music group, irrespective of its legal form. On public platforms such as streaming services, the group name is usually the observable identity, not the underlying business registration.

### Music publishing and sound recording agents

On the recording side, agents include those who:

- License works for sound recording
- Produce and distribute recordings commercially
- Facilitate public performance or synchronisation with audiovisual content

These agents include music publishers, record labels, and distributors.

Music publishers are relatively easy to register, as they are usually incorporated legal persons. Under the *Collective Rights Management Directive* [@eu_directive_2014_26], their identities must be made public if they rely on collective management. This allows direct inclusion in the register.

Record labels, by contrast, are more loosely defined. While many are legal entities, some operate informally or as subsidiaries within larger businesses. Only large, formalised labels typically have music publishing or releasing as their primary NACE-classified activity.

The national IFPI register provides a partially public resource: it reserves ISRC registrant identifiers for commercial releases. These identifiers operate similarly to ISBNs for books, enabling tracking of commercial recordings. However, ISRC registrants are not always labels:

- Sub-publishing and sub-labelling are common
- Small labels may release recordings via external distributors
- Global distributors (such as TuneCore) often act as direct ISRC registrants [@iso_isrc_2019]

This complexity means that while ISRC codes help trace sound recordings, they do not always resolve cleanly to a label or economic agent. Our register accommodates this by recording the observable entity—such as the name under which a recording is released—and linking it, where possible, to a business or legal identity.

## Surveying music diversity

### Open Music Europe WP2: Music Diversity

Tasks `T2.2` and `T2.3` of the *Open Music Europe* project focus on developing better tools to measure music diversity in Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland.

*Diversity in music* can refer to several dimensions: the identity of creators and performers, the musical works themselves, or how works are programmed and distributed. Initiatives such as KeyChange seek measurable gender balance on stages, while funding bodies increasingly promote the visibility of women composers and ethnic minority cultures.

Another dimension of diversity is access to a broad repertoire, monitored through tools such as broadcast quotas or public performance regulations. These often include requirements for minimum percentages of local music, youth-created content, or works by women and underrepresented groups. Some diversity objectives are also genre-specific.

Capturing this range of diversity requires a register that connects people to works, and works to their manifestations. For example, Slovak local content regulations define "Slovak music" by linking Slovak-language lyrics or performer/composer residence to a work or recording. Other rules, such as French or Hungarian radio quotas, similarly link agent properties—such as age, gender, or ethnicity—to musical outputs.

These requirements overlap with economic measurement but also introduce greater complexity. For corporate bodies such as music groups, diversity analysis may require details on group composition (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity)—categories considered sensitive personal data under GDPR. Capturing such data is essential for monitoring benchmarks like [KeyChange](https://www.keychange.eu/) but must be managed with strong safeguards.

### Registration of musical entities

To support this kind of measurement, our data model introduces a distinct class of *musical entities*, including:

- *Musical works*
- *Sound recordings* (fixations of performances)
- *Live performances* (public-facing, non-rehearsal events)
- *Print music* (sheet music, scores)
- *Lyrics* (often literary works linked to compositions)

These entities are currently spread across fragmented, often non-public registers maintained by various rights organisations. Connecting them requires careful negotiation between transparency and proprietary control. In many cases, registration is tied to commercial incentives—such as rights management and royalty tracking—which creates tensions when such data is reused for policy evaluation or diversity monitoring.

For example, linking performer demographics to a sound recording may reveal important insights about representation on streaming platforms, but it also raises questions about data access, consent, and equitable visibility. Navigating this space requires both legal interoperability and a trust framework between data holders.
