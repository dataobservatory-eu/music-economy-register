# Surveying {#sec-surveying}

Using our register to administer surveys requires an extension towards GSIM and DDI. This report focuses on identifying the universe (or target population) and coverage (or survey population). These need to be connected to the responses given to questions, which need to be then formed into measured variables. We are ambitious to build an ex-ante and ex-post surveying harmonisation system, but we will present this in a separate paper. We aim to ensure that our surveys target a well-established universe and reach a reasonable and measurable coverage.

The statistical business register is an essential tool for creating survey frames or sample frames, in other words, to organise statistical data collection. In non-technical terms, this register is necessary to decide who should get a data request.

-   For a *sample survey*, the register is used to draw a lottery of those members of the population who will be invited to provide data.

-   In a *census*-type survey, all registered members of the population, for example, all music labels, will receive an invitation to an interview or form.

-   In the case of *a register-based survey*, all members of the register, for example, all collective management societies in the territory, will be requested to send data directly from their databases.

## Extending with GSIM

To make this register usable for surveying, we must make some connections between ex-ante and ex-post survey harmonisation with our data model. In the ex-ante harmonisation task, we need to connect questions on a survey to representations of the question and then the representations to the computational algorithm of the desired output variable, which already leads to retrospective data processing. This requires using some well-defined DDI term in the process of planning the survey. After the fieldwork, some SDMX statistical terms are needed to process the answers from the survey. The DDI representation model class connects the planned processing of the answers with the programmed questionnaire in the fieldwork data collection application.

GSIM (Generic Statistical Information Model), SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange), and DDI (Data Documentation Initiative) are three complementary standards used in official statistics and research data management. Their relationship can be summarized as follows:

-   [x] `GSIM`: A conceptual framework that provides a standardized way to describe the information needed to produce official statistics. It defines objects, attributes, and relationships to support metadata management [@GSIM_v20_2014].

-   [x] `SDMX`: A technical standard primarily used for exchanging statistical data and metadata between organizations. It includes data structures, classification systems, and protocols for efficient data sharing. SDMX is supported with a published ontology. See our data model in a different paper.

-   [x] `DDI` A metadata standard focused on survey and research data, covering data collection, management, and archiving [@sdmx_information_model_v3]. It supports metadata documentation throughout the data lifecycle. Only a small part of DDI is supported with a published and evolving ontology, but that is sufficient for our purposes.

### Identifying the subjects

The **Agent** classes relate to the data subjects in the target population. In administrative or enterprise surveys, we can connect the responses with a unique identifier of the **Agent**, if that exists, for example, a company registration code.

In population surveys, we often work with anonymous responses, which requires extensive categorisation. We need the respondents' profiles to generalise their answers (e.g., which respondents were women, men, composers, or technicians). Unless we work with a large, expensive, genuinely random sample or a full-coverage census, we also need these categories to fill in response quotas (and ensure that not only men or composers answer).

We must create categorical variables for anonymous surveys that put the Agent into a correct Agent category (for example, "Composers"). This problem overlaps with adding roles, economic activities or occupations to the survey data. These relate to the activities in our agent model; persons composing music receive royalties, or their work is visible (audible) on a stage.

The Agent classes will be sorted into categorical variables used to group or slice the dataset; for example, separate income averages will be calculated for performers, composers, and producers.

#### Occupational and economic results for music entities

We are often interested in quantifying the results of such activities in terms of natural numbers (number of works composed or registered in the survey time frame) or royalties received after already existing compositions in a time frame. Royalties received in 2025 can only relate to compositions registered in 2024 or before.

The variable representation model here is usually some form of simple numeric representation with an unambiguous unit of measure; for example, in Slovakia, composers give answers about income in euros, while in Hungary, they answer in Hungarian forints. The numerical representation must code unambiguously logically missing values (the subject was filtered out and could not answer), declined answers (the subject knows the answer but is unwilling to share it) and unknown answers (subjects claiming that they cannot answer the question.) The different units of measure and the different categories of missing answers will be processed ex-ante the survey, but they must be well designed beforehand.

#### Ex-post processing

The ex post-processing is reasonably simple if the ex ante variable representation is well-designed. Numerical variables go through well-established algorithms to report their median, average or somehow weighted average values; missing values are counted as categories in each missingness group (filtered, unknown and declined.) Population groups are used to group the calculation and later slice the resulting multi-dimensional output table. For example, if the grouping relates to the respondent replying from Slovakia or Hungary, these categories are added to the unprocessed microdata; separate mean and median values are reported for the two groups, and they are added to a single data table (called "datacube" in SDMX) where Slovak and Hungarian results can be subsetted (or "sliced" in the SDMX statistical language.)

## Surveying the music economy

In @sec-t12 we already extended our conceptual model with two important DDI concepts: the **Universe** and **Coverage**.

### Open Music Europe WP1 Music Economy

These are the Task 1.2 and related tasks to collect better and more comprehensive data about the Slovak, Hungarian and Polish music economies.

In this case, we want to survey what music business actors do. By music business actors, we mean people, groups of people in a corporate body, potentially incorporating legal persons having an agency in some economic activities, particularly receiving a net turnover from royalties, live performances or other activities; employing people; and creating gross value added after deducting their costs. Their gross value added is a component of their regional or national GDP.

Agents engage in economic activities or economic processes whose results are our primary interests. They organise concerts and festivals and sell tickets, hoping for a net turnover and high enough value added to remain economically sustainable. They release sound recordings for commercial use via the sale of mechanical copies and their use in licensed public performances. They also license musical works to create sound recordings, stage theatrical works, or synchronise music with feature, documentary, or advertising films.

Corporate body agents' economic activities are usually described with an ISIC/NACE classification and human agents' activities with ISCO/ESCO. Sole proprietors, who are frequent agents in music, have an ISCO/ESCO classification that they may not be aware of and an extended 5-digit NACE code, which connects the economic occupation of a sole proprietor to the NACE system. Unfortunately, the 5-digit extension is not harmonised on the EU level.

#### Performing arts agents

On the performing side, the main actor or **agent** class is an individual in a role of a `musician` or its narrower `instrumentalist` or `vocalist`role; the corporate body of the `music group`. Music groups have different sizes and compositions in each genre, they are often called a a band, a (symphony) orchestra, an ensemble, a duo, a trio, or a choir in the case of strictly vocal music[^surveying-1].

[^surveying-1]: For data modelling purposes, a solo performer can be seen as a group of one, even though we would perhaps not call them a group.

Some orchestras with stable membership have a related entity, a formal business incorporated as a form of partnership or a limited liability company. It is also customary that public broadcasting organisations, opera houses and music theatres maintain orchestras, therefore connecting the orchestra to a registered, usually public institution. And in popular music, the musical group often forms an informal enterprise, without running their performance fees and expenses through a formal accounting system.

Mapping these performing agents to companies is possible but requires work; currently, we aim to register the corporate body of the musical group, with the possibility of linking a business entity to the corporate body. For example, on streaming services, it is always the musical group that is observable, not the limited company of the group members.

#### Music publishing and sound recording agents

The agents on the recording side of the music business are licensing the work of composers (musical works) and lyricists (that may be literary works) for the recording of their performances (sound recordings), which may be sold in mechanical copies, used in public performance or music streaming, or can be bundled with theatrical staged performances or various feature, documentary or advertising film.

The corporate bodies dealing with these activities are the music publishers and the record labels, who are helped by distributors.

On the recorded music side, music publishing is easier to register because the agents are almost always incorporated enterprises. The Collective Rights Management Directive [@directive_2014_26] ensures that those agents that use collective management to receive their royalties should be made public. Regarding author's rights management, publishers are almost always legal persons, and we can add them to our public register without a problem. However, labels are less well-defined; they are usually corporate bodies operating within all kinds of business entities. Only larger recording labels have a primary or exclusive economic activity in releasing sound recordings as a main economic activity.

For labels, there is a publicly observable register of labels that is large enough to reserve a range of identifiers for commercial releases in a national IFPI register. This registrar, which is similar to book registration (and music sheet registration, which grew out of book registration), allows larger labels to assign an ISRC code to their sound recording releases for commercial purposes. Sub-publishing and sub-labelling are commonplace in the music industry, but they are better handled by publishing; many small labels do not register their commercial sound recordings via a larger label enterprise but directly via a distributor. Some distributors, like TuneCore, have a right to manage recording registration at par with countries (it has a top-level International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) domain), and other distributors may have the right to register sound recording releases in their range. So, the registrant identifier in the ISRC code of a sound recording does not necessarily connect to a sound recording label.[@iso_isrc_2019]

## Surveying music diversity

### Open Music Europe WP2 Music Economy

These are the Task 2.2 and T23. to collect better and more comprehensive data about the Slovak, Hungarian and Polish music diversity.

Surveying music for diversity relates to various aspects of diversity. It may relate to the diversity of music performers or creators. For example, the KeyChange initiative wants to ensure a higher and measurable presence for women and gender minority performers on stages. Many concert halls and funding agencies want to ensure a higher visibility for women composers. The visibility of the culture of ethnic minorities is also an important cultural and diversity policy goal.

Another important aspect of diversity is access to diverse musical programming, in which case we measure the diversity of musical works and their recorded manifestations that are used in public performance or even education. Various local content regulations mandate radios, televisions or other user agents to use a pre-defined minimum percentage of locally produced music or music produced by young people, women, etc. Often, there are genre-based music diversity goals present.

Measuring diversity requires a very complex register because the diversity of recorded music is almost always connected to the diversity of its creators. Slovak music in the local content regulation is defined as music with Slovak-language lyrics (which is a property of the musical work and its recorded manifestation, the recording) or by the residence or seat of the agent (it was written or performed by people in Slovakia; it was released by a Slovak label.) Local content regulations in Europe that want to provide visibility for ethnic minorities, young artists or women also connect the properties of an agent (the composer or the performer) to a musical work or its recorded fixation.

In either case, our registration needs overlap but far exceed the economic measurements. For corporate bodies such as musical groups, we may need the exact membership and gender, age, or ethnicity properties of the group; we are talking here about exceptionally sensitive data under GDPR. Access to such data is a prerequisite to monitoring KeyChange objectives with the percentage of non-male authors on stage or fulfilling French, Hungarian, and Slovak radio quota regulations.

### Registration of musical entities

In this case, our data model requires a new Entity class type. This music entity superclass contains the **Musical work**, its **Sound recording** (recorded fixation of a performance) and its **Live performance** (a non-rehearsal performance meant for the public.) The musical work also has a print manifestation. Often, the music accompanies a Literary work, for example, a poem is arranged to be performed with music.

**Musical works**, **Lyrics**, **Sound Recordings**, and **Print music** have different, usually non-public, registers. Access to such registers requires a very complex balancing of developing new business for music, increasing measurable diversity (or avoiding "pinkwashing", where for example, unsubstantiated claims are made for equal stage/broadcasting access for women or minorities), and the business interests of those organisations who have invested into the registers and use the registration process for rights management. The well-known conflict of interest among authors', producers' and performers' remuneration, for example, makes the connection of such registers complex even within the music industry, not to mention its opening up for diversity measurement and reporting purposes.
