abstract="The article considers the special class of ontology-driven lexicographic systems. The principles of their formation and use for processing large numbers of network documents are described. The rules of interaction with network information resources based on transformation of text documents into an interactive format are presented. The rules of formation of ontological systems that implement document structuring functions, the information display functions and functional management are described. The process of formation of monodiciplinary and multidisciplinary L-systems is described. The principles of formation of semiotically and semantically organized information environment are described. The definition of lexicographic effect is given. The hyperproperty of the inductance of a set of elementary information units (EIU) is presented. The flexibility of ontologies is described, which makes them a convenient mechanism for describing almost any data structure, so in addition to the actual EIU and their descriptions (i.e. information processed by the system). An ontology-driven system architecture is defined for a class of lexicographic systems. This architecture implements procedures of taxonomy-based management, which allows dynamic change of the set of available functions, interfaces, and so on. The operations that implement transdisciplinary integration of arbitrary documents in active modes of interaction are defined.",
