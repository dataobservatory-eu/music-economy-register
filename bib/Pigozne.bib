Balstoties uz šajos novados saglabātajām tradicionālā apģērba daļām un izceļot atšķirīgo, veidoti novadu tautastērpi. Pētījuma mērķis ir izzināt novadu iedalījuma tapšanas gaitu un pamatotību attiecībā uz Latgales tradicionālo apģērbu. Lai noskaidrotu, kā šādi novadi izveidoti, pētītas līdz šim tapušās novadu kartes, izsekots novadu pamatojumos lietotajai argumentācijai un analizēts, cik unikālas un kādā laika posmā izteiktas ir tās pazīmes apģērbā, pēc kurām Latgalē nošķirts katrs novads. Secinājumi ļauj pārskatīt līdzšinējo uz ģeogrāfiskām atšķirībām fokusēto pieeju tradicionālā apģērba izpētē.},

Fotogrāfijas tapušas, gatavojoties Krievijas Etnogrāfiskajai izstādei, un ir vērtīgs latviešu tradicionālā apģērba vēstures izziņas avots. Tā kā muzeju krātuvēs saglabājušies tikai atsevišķi apģērba gabali no dažādām vietām un dažādiem laikiem, fotogrāfijas palīdz noskaidrot, kādi bija apģērba komplekti. Tās liecina, ka šajā laikā zemnieces vairs nevalkāja vainagus un izšūtās villaines, bet galvā sēja krāsainus lakatus un ap pleciem sedza baltas villaines. Vīrieši arvien biežāk valkāja naģenes. Sieviešu apģērbā vērojamas lielākas variācijas, kamēr vīriešu apģērbi ir savā starpā līdzīgāki.},

	abstract = {It is a paper published in the Proceedings of the 60th International Scientific Conference of the Daugavpils University.The paper discusses reuse and second use of pieces of clothing and accessories worn by the Latvian-speaking peasants living in Daugavpils, Ludza, and Rēzekne districts of the Governorate of Vitebsk in the 19th century.{\textless}br{\textgreater}
	Traditional clothing reflects the local traditions of producing, ornamenting and wearing clothing and it was worn by local Latvian peasants till the second half of the 19th century. Latgalian traditional clothing has not been researched to the same extent as that of the other regions.{\textless}br{\textgreater}
  This paper studies how items of traditional clothing in Latgale were reused and therefore were not collected by museums, as well as what effect this had on the formation of the museum collections and what has to be considered when researching traditional Latgalian dress. It analyses evidence of reused garments and repurposed accessories when they were outworn or out of fashion. It is based on a thorough examination of the interviews carried out by the ethnographers of the Monument Board in 1925, 1926, 1937, and 1943, drawings, photographs and garments stored at the National History Museum of Latvia, Archives of Latvian Folklore, as well as interviews carried out by Ieva Pigozne in 2017. This paper reveals one part of the results of the postdoctoral research project “Development of Folk Dress in Latgale in the 19th Century” funded by The European Regional Development Fund.{\textless}br{\textgreater}
  This paper concludes that Latgalian peasant’s festive clothing was usually worn as everyday clothing when it was worn out; many garments were reused as leg wraps or nappies for babies. Footwear was worn as long as possible or kept for funerary attire. Thus there was rarely anything left to be collected by the museums in the first half of the 20th century. Such popular accessories as woollen sashes were usually repurposed and were used as decorative gift wraps, for lowering a coffin into the grave during the funeral, tying babies or as upper parts of slippers. Sashes were still made and kept in many homes till the World War II but they were not used for holding the ladies’ skirts as in the first half of the 19th century. Abundance of sashes contributed to creation of a misconception that they were used together with traditional clothing and thus to unfounded formation of sets of Latgalian traditional clothing.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to find out the possible date of unique evidence of traditional dress - tunic from Rudzāti parish, its possible combination with other garments and its significance in the research of traditional dress of Latgale. The analysis of the source was performed, marking its place in the context of the written and iconographic sources of dress history.
	The study uses the materials of the National History Museum of Latvia (LNVM), Jēkabpils History Museum (JVM) and the Latvian Ethnographic Open-Air Museum (LEBM), as well as the published materials of the University of Latvia Academic Library.
	The tunic (CVVM 10762) is made of dark blue wool fabric. Bead embroidery is made around the neckline and the ends of the sleeves, using yellow, white, and green beads. The sleaves are decorated with tablet-woven bands. The bottom of the tunic is unevenly cut, so its total original length is unknown.
	This type of tunic in the collection of LNVM is only one from the whole of Latvia, so it is possible to say that it is a unique testimony to the history of dress. It came to the collection of the Ethnography Department of the museum in 1923 from the farm of “Elksnīši” in Rudzāti parish of Daugavpils district.
	Judging by the analysis of various details of the tunic and their comparison with similar evidence of the history of traditional dress, it can be concluded that the tunic probably dates to the period between the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. This allows the wearing of a tunic to be linked to the time of wearing single-color woollen garments with colourful embroidery.
	The tunic also shows that the upper garments with the ancient tunic cut may have been made till the first half of the 19th century. However, there is no other evidence of tunics in Latgale during this period.
	The tunic is a unique material testimony that complements the written and iconographic sources and serves as an important reference in the further research of Latgalian traditional dress.},
