	abstract = {The objective of this Report is to lay the groundwork for the preparation of the Cluster 2 {WP} Calls to support the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage for the period of 2023-2025, along three milestones: design and implementation of the basic architecture and governance; set up the steering and coordination entity; develop first real-world uses. The report has been prepared by independent European experts representing the diversity of current Cultural Heritage, as illustrated in the short biographies at the end of the Report. The experts have held twelve meetings between November 2021 and March 2022, in which they thoroughly discussed the context, the possibilities and the specificities of the future Cloud. They could also rely on the outcomes of a Stakeholder Meeting on 12 November 2021, and of the related survey summarized in the Appendix of the Report. The Report is divided into three Parts: General Motivations; Current Status of the Cultural Heritage Domain; Implementation Plan for the Cloud.},
