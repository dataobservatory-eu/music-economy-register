  abstract = {Access to data collected by the private sector could help local administrations to comply with their public-interest mission. Privately held data access by public bodies, however, is an emerging field with no established praxis yet. Its in-the-making status makes it a compelling subject for a research on the “politics of data”, since it allows looking at the power (un)balances between the companies holding data and the local administrations interested in it as well as citizens’ role. The contribution discusses the findings of a qualitative exploratory research that investigated the experiences and perspectives of local administrations regarding access to privately held personal data. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted with the innovation/data managers of twelve European local administrations. The interviews allowed contextualizing concrete experiences of data sharing in the discourses and viewpoints of the specialists working in this area, as well as the strategies they plan to put forward for facilitating access. The study illustrates how these cities’ managers experience four operational modes to access private data: data donorship, public procurement of data, data sharing partnerships and tender obligations. The results highlight new divides caused by the unequal possibilities to access private data, as cities with more experience and better reputation are in a favorable position both to establish partnerships and receive data at no cost. The findings also suggest that public managers would like to retain sovereignty of data, co-create instead of acquire data- driven solutions, and that are imagining collective forms of negotiation to enhance their access to private data.},

@misc{unknown_businessto_n.d.,
  abstract = {Lately governments and companies began experimenting with voluntary data sharing of business data for addressing public problems (so-called Data Collaboratives). This early practice revealed a number of challenges impeding business-to-government (B2G) data sharing and thus limiting the potential of data to provide answers and guide policies and action. One of the key challenges is the lack of a clear regulatory framework for B2G data sharing. To tackle this issue, the European Commission is taking regulatory action and preparing the Data Act which aims to spell out the rules and conditions for B2G data sharing for public interest. These developments, however, are met with resistance. While there is a strong push from the public sector for more private sector data, the private sector is less enthusiastic about the prospective mandatory B2G data sharing. In our study we zoom in on this issue in more detail and pose the following research question: How do public and private sector actors in the European Union view the prospect of mandatory B2G data sharing for public interest? To answer this question, we analyze the open dataset of responses to the public consultation of the European Commission. We find statistically significant results of business opposition to regulatory action and to mandating B2G data sharing, particularly among telecom and finance sectors. We also conclude that opposition to mandatory data sharing varies depending on the public interest purpose and is lowest among businesses with regards to emergencies and highest with regard to education, inclusion, and statistics.},

  abstract = {Abstract Climate change, pandemics and urban planning are just a few of the societal challenges that an efficient exploit of data could allow the public sector to tackle. In this perspective, business-to-government (B2G) data sharing can benefit the social good and allow for better policy decisions. Nevertheless, the possibility for the public sector to access privately-held data remains mostly unexplored. This contribution aims to explore the possible evolution of B2G sharing models within the future systems of data governance by evaluating rationales to foster government access to privately-held data and by analysing some of the barriers that hinder this kind of exploitation. This essay then seeks to present models of B2G data circulation through which societal benefits and data sharing could be improved; specifically, it focuses on the options of voluntary and mandatory B2G data sharing and outlines concrete experiences of B2G data sharing between private entities and European local administrations.},
