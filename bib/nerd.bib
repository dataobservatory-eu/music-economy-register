	abstract = {Digital transformation brings about new challenges for public collections. In addition to digitizing cultural collections, they must also ensure that the digital fragmentation of institutions that exists in the real world is eliminated, and provide visitors with services that are representative of the complexity of culture and its multidimensional relationships. One way to do this is to use namespaces. This article describes how to interpret the concept of namespaces, and their different types based on their structure, the types of names and the collection profile of individual namespaces, as well as the entity types handled in namespaces.},
