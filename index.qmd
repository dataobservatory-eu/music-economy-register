**Registration** is an essential but often burdensome process in the music sector. Musicians and their organisations repeatedly enter the same information‚Äîabout people, works, recordings, or venues‚Äîinto multiple systems: membership lists, royalty platforms, event calendars, licensing databases, and more. This leads to duplication, outdated records, and increasing instances of unregulated data scraping across platforms.

This report proposes a way forward: by developing open, interoperable registers that can be shared across institutions, we can reduce the effort required to maintain music-related metadata while increasing its value for statistics, rights management, and research.

A **register**, in IT terms, is a dataset that supports structured workflows. For example, a membership register should reflect new and departing members; a rights register should update when a composer dies and an heir inherits. Registers underpin specific applications: artists register with distributors to publish music, with CMOs to collect royalties, or with researchers to take part in surveys.

A key aspect of registration is the creation and maintenance of metadata descriptions of people, works, recordings, and venues. These descriptions can also serve as proxies for the entities themselves in workflows such as rights management and statistics. Equally important is the registration of the person or musical item itself‚Äîfor example, depositing an original score or a sound recording of the composition to support later identification.

Maintaining such systems is time-consuming and costly. Many fail not for technical reasons but because the expected benefits do not justify the effort required for complete and accurate registration. In some cases, conflicts of interest discourage collaboration, such as when proprietary identifiers (e.g. ISRC, ISWC) are reused without oversight or cost-sharing. Maintaining registers‚Äînot only the metadata but also the identification of works, recordings, and people‚Äîis an expensive process that carries significant liabilities. Our goal is to deliver a solution that preserves the integrity and investment of ISWC, ISRC, and ISMN registrars while reducing two of the most costly tasks: resolving conflicts and correcting entity mismatches.

While identifiers such as ISWC and ISRC serve immediate business and rights-management purposes, the same works and recordings often enter a second lifecycle in cultural heritage institutions. Music libraries and archives preserve scores, sound recordings, manuscripts, and even rights-management records for long-term research and cultural memory. Open Music Registers creates metadata that can move across these contexts without loss of meaning.

`Open Music Registers` proposes a solution: a **shared, open, and interoperable infrastructure** where carefully harmonised registers can serve multiple purposes simultaneously‚Äîrights management, statistics, cultural policy, research, and business innovation.

The `Open Music Registers` project offers a new, practical approach to managing registration processes in the music sector, focusing on reducing redundancy in the *metadata layer* of registration. Currently, musicians and organisations repeatedly submit the same data‚Äîabout people, works, recordings, or venues‚Äîto multiple isolated systems. This duplication increases administrative costs, introduces inconsistencies, and leads to outdated or fragmented records. In this report, registration refers primarily to the creation and maintenance of metadata descriptions of people, works, recordings, and venues. These descriptions can also serve as proxies for the entities themselves in workflows such as rights management and statistics.

A register, in this context, is a curated set of metadata items designed to support structured workflows and maintain authoritative descriptions of entities. While a register often reflects a population (e.g. all members or works), it is the metadata‚Äînot the entities themselves‚Äîthat are maintained, versioned, and governed.

Building on the foundations of the *Open Music Europe* project [@openmuse_2023], we apply modern data governance standards (such as the European Interoperability Framework, FAIR principles, and dataspace design patterns) to streamline registration processes while respecting GDPR and domain-specific requirements. We use technologies such as **Wikibase**‚Äîthe platform behind **Wikidata**‚Äîto create flexible, multilingual, standards-compliant knowledge bases.

Our work focuses initially on Slovakia, where we have developed a live, updateable **Slovak Music Economy Register** that covers:

-   Composers, publishers, performers, and producers,
-   In an exploratory phase, venues and events,
-   Business entities linked to cultural and economic activities.

*Within `WP2` we are building a comprehensive database of sound recordings and musical works connected to composers, performers, publishers, and record labels.*

We align these datasets with international standards (ISNI, ISRC, ISWC, ISMN, OpenCorporates, ESCO, NACE, ISCO) while incorporating DCTERMS elements for general metadata interoperability and RiC entities and relationships for archival context. This ensures that music metadata is not only operationally useful but also preservation-ready.

Our system is conceived not as a centralised database but as a **federated dataspace** that respects the autonomy and ownership of each contributor while enabling more efficient data reuse, discoverability, and analysis. It integrates seamlessly with European initiatives such as the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

Open Music Registers is designed to cover the full lifecycle of music-related data: from active registration and rights management to long-term preservation in libraries and archives. Our model incorporates Dublin Core Terms (DCTERMS) for descriptive metadata and lifecycle events, and aligns with the archival description framework Records in Contexts (RiC) to ensure that works, recordings, and associated documents can transition seamlessly from operational registers into heritage collections.

The ultimate goal is to reduce the burden on artists, improve the quality and visibility of music metadata, and enable cultural and economic indicators that are currently missing from national and EU statistics. By building a multi-purpose, standards-aligned infrastructure, we aim to bridge the worlds of cultural heritage, the creative industries, and official statistics‚Äîlaying the groundwork for more inclusive, efficient, and evidence-based
