**Registration** is a necessary but burdensome process in the music sector. Musicians and their organisations routinely enter the same information—about people, works, recordings, or venues—into multiple systems: membership lists, royalty systems, event calendars, licensing databases, and more. The result is often duplication, outdated records, and growing cases of unregulated data scraping across platforms.

This report presents a way forward: by developing open, interoperable registers that can be shared across institutions, we reduce the effort of maintaining music-related metadata and increase its utility for statistics, rights management, and research.

A register, in IT terms, is a dataset that supports structured workflows. For example, a membership register should reflect new and departed members; a rights register should update when a composer dies and an heir inherits. Registers support specific applications: artists register with distributors to publish music, with CMOs to collect royalties, or with researchers to take part in surveys.

Maintaining these systems is time-consuming and costly. Many fail not for technical reasons, but because the expected benefits don’t justify the effort required for complete and accurate registration. In some cases, conflicts of interest also discourage collaboration—such as when proprietary identifiers (e.g. ISRC, ISWC) are reused without oversight or cost-sharing.

This report draws on recent innovations in data modelling, metadata standards, and semantic interoperability to show how registration burdens can be reduced—especially when multiple organisations are collecting overlapping metadata. If a rights agency and a music library are cataloguing the same work, why not share the cost of validation?

We use the term **interoperability** as defined in the European Interoperability Framework: legal, organisational, semantic, and technical. This paper focuses on the **organisational** and **semantic** layers—specifically how different institutions can work with the same concepts (e.g. authorship, manifestation) in consistent, shareable ways.

Our use case is economic measurement in the music sector. To estimate the income, turnover, or employment of music professionals and companies, we must first define the **universe**—a register of relevant agents (e.g. all active music publishers in Slovakia). Once that’s in place, we can connect these agents to administrative data (e.g. tax filings, company reports) or select a representative sample for survey.

This documentation is structured as follows: 

- We introduce the conceptual and policy background for open music registers (@sec-ambition); 

- We describe the economic agent register developed in Slovakia (@sec-t12); 

- And we outline how it can be used to support administrative and sample surveys in cultural statistics (@sec-surveying).

We touch only briefly on the issue of surveying musical diversity, which will be addressed in a separate report. That work focuses not only on agents—composers, producers, performers—but also on their creative outputs: works, lyrics, recordings, and editions.
