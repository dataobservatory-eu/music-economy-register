**Registration** is the act or process of entering information about something or somebody in a bookkeeping or other record-keeping application. Most music organisations maintain a register or registry: a list of members, information files on rightsholders, or music sheets available for study or borrowing in a library. As music is distributed and documented increasingly online, musicians and their groups and associations must fill out registrations for various digital services almost every day. The amount of registered data becomes daunting and terrifying, and maintaining all these data is very tiring. As a result, the registers contain a lot of outdated data, and we see increasing illegal activities by private registry holders to find data about music entities in other systems and copy it without permission or supervision. With our innovation we would like to show how music organisation can reduce this burden, harmonise their registration processes, and create more useful and up-to-date registers.

A register in an IT system is a dataset or a database that follows precisely described workflows on the continuous data update. For example, a membership register needs to add new members as they join and delete members who leave; in rights management registers, it must add an heir of the right if the member dies.

The datasets or databases of registers are designed to serve an application that provides IT support to a workflow, process, or task. Self-releasing artists register with a distributor to distribute their recordings; authors register with a collective management organisation to collect their royalties from mechanical and public performance licenses. Our statisticians and researchers use a register to survey the members (population) in the register.

Maintaining registers is a continuous and costly task. We believe that the often perceived low data and metadata quality in music is related to the low economic value of the applications that use the registration process or due to conflicts of interest. If registering to service will result in the registering entity's 20 euros of expected cash flows annually, a registration process requiring 100 euros to finish flawlessly will not work. We often see sloppy registration procedures because the expected benefits do not justify the burden of a correct, validated registration. Conflicts of interest can arise in various scenarios. A simple scenario is that an organisation maintains a high-value register, and other users try to freeride on using their product, for example, a unique identifier such as the ISWC or the ISCR code. 

In this report, we want to show that by applying novel innovations from data and metadata management, information and computer science, and business process innovations in the music sector, we may overcome some registration problems resulting in royalty collection problems or poor quality statistics. We do this in two ways: applying innovations that generally reduce the costs of maintaining a register and increasing their interoperability so that at least some of the registration workflows can be shared by many organisations. If a rights management agency and a library are registering the same metadata at a great cost, in the absence of a clear conflict of interest, they can share this metadata recording and validation cost. 

We use the term "interoperability" as it is defined in the European Interoperability Framework. This four-layered definition of legal, organisational, semantic, and technical interoperability enables the same data to be used in various registration processes. This paper deals mainly with the organisational and semantic aspects, but the legal policy aspects can be outlined clearly in other related tasks.

What do we mean by organisational and semantic interoperability? One of the costliest data problems in music is connecting a registered musical work to its recorded and print manifestation (the composition of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5. with recordings and sheets of this particular symphony, and not mistaking it with somebody else's 5th symphony.) Such problems are currently solved parallel in rights management agencies, music libraries, and archives. 

The organisational aspect of making this process interoperable is that we understand how a rights management professional or a librarian tries to establish the connections between Beethoven as the author, his work, and its various manifestations. The semantic aspect of interoperability is that they understand the same way what the "authorship" of a job means or exactly what the "manifestation" connection between an abstract work and its sound recording is.

The devil is always in the details, and legal interoperability must be addressed at some point. A sound recording may be cleared as a "commercial release" and can be communicated to the public, while another is only a recorded, fixed performance of the same work that may only be played within the archive. Each sound recording may connect to various performers and producers.

In this report, we focus on the use of an interoperable register system that aims to accurately measure the economic activities and associated revenues or costs of music. (In T2.2, we focus on the artistic processes and outputs regarding diversity.) Our registers must define a clear universe of music economic agents (for example, all music publishers active in the Slovak market) so we can connect them via administrative and sample surveys. Administrative surveys can connect this universe to their company, royalty, or national accounts data, such as their net turnover in the company house register, a financial database, a tax return form, or statistical filing. Sample surveys can design a good coverage of respondents (from the universe of Slovak music publishers, for example) that represent well enough the universe, for instance, whose net turnover data, after some form of averaging, correctly estimates the average net turnover of all Slovak publishers.

If we want to measure the average, median, maximum or minimum net turnover of music publishers operating in Slovakia, we must align our data in two ways. We have to be able to point out every single music publisher (say, by their company registration number) or every music publisher of a well-designed subsample of all Slovak music publishers. In other words, this identifies the data subject. Then, we want to measure the net turnover. In that case, we have to point out each of these enterprises' net turnover in their annual report, corporate accounts, tax returns, statistical forms, or questionnaire cells.

A register's goal is to identify the data subject. Regarding the GSIM or DDI, a register helps identify data subjects or respondents. We design or register that it understands that the work does not stop here; we also must be able to connect a so-called variable representation for the 'net turnover' variable. We will return to this problem at the end of the document, but these solutions go beyond the scope of creating the register and lead to the data governance and processes of administering a survey as a data collection exercise.
 
@sec-ambition gives an overall overview of the idea of open music registers.

@sec-t12 aims to describe the registers of the agents (data subjects) of the music activities.

@sec-surveying [less finalised] states what is necessary to use our register for carrying out administrative, census-like or sample surveys for estimating or measuring economic activities.

We only briefly touch the issue of surveying music diversity, which will be discussed in a separate report: in that case we must work with not only agents (composers, producers, performers) but also with their repertoire of music works and lyrics, recorded and print manifestations.
