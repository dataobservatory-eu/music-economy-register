**Registration** is the act or process of entering information about something or somebody in a bookkeeping or other record-keeping application. Most music organisations maintain a register or registry: a list of members, information files on rightsholders, or music sheets available for study or borrowing in a library. As music is distributed and documented increasingly online, musicians and their groups and associations must fill out registrations for various digital services almost every day. The amount of registered data becomes daunting and terrifying, and maintaining all these data is very tiring. As a result, the registers contain a lot of outdated data, and we see increasing illegal activities by private registry holders to find data about music entities in other systems and copy it without permission or supervision. With our innovation we would like to show how music organisation can reduce this burden, harmonise their registration processes, and create more useful and up-to-date registers.

The lack of cooperation results in poor digital services, high costs, and very high risks of data breaches. Our vision for a shared registration process entails a website where an artist can fill out all the necessary documents in a form and give appropriate GDPR consent for all essential services:

-   [x] Register for rights management. This allows existing members to update or verify their data, and for non-members, it starts a membership or representation process.

-   [x] When meeting the notability criteria, add the artist or artist group data to a national/regional music information services database.

-   [x] Appear on open knowledge platforms like Wikipedia, Wikidata, or MusicBrainz.

-   [x] A health check on all the data that the artist data needs to be represented on digital services, for example, on licensed streaming platforms.

-   [x] Advice on the pros/cons of revealing information for visibility in autonomous systems (recommender algorithms of radios, streaming playlists, festival curation) and placing the selected information on open knowledge graphs where most digital services will automatically find the data.

-   [x] Placing the artists' or groups' data into a satellite register would improve the country's statistical register and allow the creation of better music statistics.

Such a register should be useful for the administration of revenues, particularly royalty revenues; making business analysis and plans for public and private services, and even for advocacy; or to research various aspects of music.

This document focuses on what aspect of our open registers, registering agents with music occupations as natural persons, and economic and artistic activities of music corporate bodies, weather informal or formal will find useful.

@sec-ambition gives an overall overview of the idea of open music registers.

@sec-t12 aims to describe the registers of the agents (data subjects) of the music activities.

@sec-surveying [less finalised] states what is necessary to use our register for carrying out administrative, census-like or sample surveys for estimating or measuring economic activities.

We only briefly touch the issue of surveying music diversity, which will be discussed in a separate report: in that case we must work with not only agents (composers, producers, performers) but also with their repertoire of music works and lyrics, recorded and print manifestations.
